This chapter explains how  spells work and how spellcasters prepare and cast their spells.\n\nEven with the widespread presence of technology,  spellcasters can be found in every corner of the galaxy.  Some spellcasters draw magic from other realities, some  from their mystical connections to cosmic forces, and  others rewrite the underlying code of the universe to cast  their spells.",

The record includes the target's current Hit Points,  augmentations, attribute modifiers, and any afflictions or  conditions it had.\n\nIf the target dies of anything other than old age, it  can recall its recorded body from the Akashic Record.  This process takes 1 minute, after which time its corpse  disappears, and the target instantly reappears in the  recorded body in the corpse's space and with any worn  equipment. It re-forms standing and can choose to pick up  any equipment it dropped in the space from when it died,  assuming the equipment is still there. If it can't occupy that  space, it appears as close to the space as possible, though it  must still retrieve its equipment. It retains its mind as it was  at the time of the body's death, so it regains no expended  spells, Focus Points, or uses of special abilities. Any mental  effects affecting the target at the time of its death persist  in its new body.\n\nRetrieving the body from the Akashic Record or having  the duration expire removes the stored information from the  Akashic Record, requiring you to cast this spell again.\n\nCasting the spell replaces any previous record you've  stored with prior castings\u2014you can store only one copy of  any creature in the Akashic Record using this spell.",

During the casting  of this spell, ask about the results of a particular course of  action. The spell can predict results up to 30 minutes into the  future and reveal the GM's best guess among the following  outcomes: good, bad, mixed (the results will be a mix of good  and bad), and nothing (there won't be particularly good or  bad results).\n\nThe GM rolls a secret DC 6 flat check. On a failure, the  result is always \"nothing.\" This makes it impossible to tell  whether a \"nothing\" result is accurate. If anyone asks about  the same topic as the first casting of *augury* during an  additional casting, the GM uses the secret roll result from the  first casting. If circumstances change, though, it's possible to  get a different result.",
