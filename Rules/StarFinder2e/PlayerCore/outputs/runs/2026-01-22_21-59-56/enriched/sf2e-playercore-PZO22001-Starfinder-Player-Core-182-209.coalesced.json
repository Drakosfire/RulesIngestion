Each skill is keyed to one of your character's  attributes and used for an array of related actions. Your character's expertise in a skill comes from  several sources, including their background and class. In this chapter, you'll learn about new skill  options in Starfinder, with new skills and updated uses for existing skills.",

A circumstance, condition, or  effect might bar you from a skill action regardless of your  proficiency rank, and sometimes using a skill in a specific  situation might require you to have a higher proficiency rank  than what is listed on the table.

The GM might decide  that you can pick up where you left off, assuming  the task hasn't been completed by others in your  absence. Whether you roll a new skill check when  you resume is also up to the GM. Generally speaking,  if you had a good initial roll and want to keep it, you  can, but if you had a bad initial roll, you can't try  for a better one by pausing to do something else.  If your statistics changed during the break\u2014usually  because you leveled up while adventuring\u2014you can  attempt a new check.",
