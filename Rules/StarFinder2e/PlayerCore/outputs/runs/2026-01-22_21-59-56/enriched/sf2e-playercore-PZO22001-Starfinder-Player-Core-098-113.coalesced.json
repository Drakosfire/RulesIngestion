Choosing your  character's class is perhaps the most important decision you will make for them. Groups of players  often create characters whose skills and abilities complement each other mechanically\u2014for example,  ensuring your party includes a healer, a combat-oriented character, a stealthy character, and someone  with command over magic\u2014so you may wish to discuss options with your group before deciding!",
