Before the Veskarium invasion, technological advancement on  Pulonis stalled because of the world's unpredictable magnetic  storms. Even today, Pulonian technological development  focuses on ceramics, bioengineering, chemistry, and magic.  After breaking from the Veskarium, residents of Pulonis's  nation-states overwhelmingly voted to join the Pact Worlds,  and they're still acclimating to this new political allegiance.",

Pulonian culture values personal success and standing out  from one's peers and views all existence as a great song,  with each person, event, and action adding to the galactic  symphony that began at the dawn of time. Most pahtras enjoy  healthy and productive competition, believing that one's true  potential can emerge only from struggle. Underhandedly  sabotaging or blatantly disrespecting a rival who follows the  rules of a competition is a grave offense and usually seen as  a sign of weakness. Pahtras make an exception to this code  when facing a dishonorable foe, such as invaders from the  technologically advanced Veskarium. In such cases, any form  of resistance is acceptable, and the use of \"dirty\" tactics is  considered a wise counter to a foe's unfair advantages. Many  religious pahtras pray to Meyel, an ancestral deity of dance,  music, and battle worshipped on Pulonis.",

Shirren culture is built around this love of choice, encouraging  shirrens to adapt themselves to a wide variety of beliefs,  philosophies, and professions. Shirrens are highly communal  and tend to feel lonely unless they're part of a group. Once a  shirren chooses a community for themself, they often settle  into a specialized role. When times are tough, they pitch in  for teamwork and prioritize what's best for the group over  what only benefits them as individuals, as long as they retain  their autonomy.",

They have six arms, leading to  their use of the slang term allsix for giving one's best effort. A  skittermander's body is covered in colorful fur, most commonly  in bright shades of blue, green, purple, or red. Skittermanders  are mammals who begin life in a non-sapient larval stage called  a whelp. Skitterwhelps look like miniature skittermanders, save  that they scrabble around on all eight limbs, have bigger ears,  and have a secondary, tubelike mouth that sprouts from their  abdomen. Skitterwhelps don't do much more than eat after  birth, devouring fruits, seeds, leaves, raw meat, and any other  source of nutrients they can cram into their mouths, hopefully  with parental guidance. A skitterwhelp's stomach-mouth can  attach to large prey and secretes numbing saliva, enabling them  to cling to large animals and feed on them over time like a furry  leech. Skitterwhelps mature into skittermanders around the age  of six, when their stomach-mouths detach. Most retain their  large and undiscerning appetite throughout their lives.",
