First, find the archetype that best  fits your character concept. Then select that archetype's  dedication feat, using one of your class feat choices. Once  you've taken the dedication feat, you can select any feat from  that archetype, as long as you meet its prerequisites. Most  archetype feats are taken in place of class feats, and so these  are called archetype class feats.",
