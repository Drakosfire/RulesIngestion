Currently, the Veskarium is at war with the Azlanti Star  Empire. Conflict permeates most aspects of vesk cultures,  creating powerful militaristic empires devoted to the bloody  worship of their warrior god Damoritosh. Their brutal history  and militaristic values shape vesk, who often embrace conflict  and value strength, duty, and a personal code of honor.  Individual vesk are just as likely to apply these cultural values  to other aspects of life besides battle, notably in business and  sport, and some vesk might abandon or oppose the ruthless  values enforced by the rulers of their home worlds entirely.  It's up to each vesk to claim their role as a conqueror or a  collaborator\u2014or something else entirely.",

Today, the name for these conquered worlds  is the Veskarium, with each given a number to mark their  distance from the sun and order of conquest (such as Vesk-3  or Vesk-8). Vesk Prime, the vesk ancestral home, is the seat of  Veskarium government and the heart of their culture.\n\nVesk names typically combine elements of their parents'  names as well as those of other prominent ancestors.  Companions often shorten these names for casual use, but  doing so without permission is a grave insult.

Many ysoki have prehensile tails that  help balance and maneuvering in zero gravity as well as keen  noses that can identify complex chemicals by smell.\n\nYsoki instinctually maintain cleanliness through personal  grooming and reinforce these habits throughout their strong  social structures. Many ysoki use cosmetics to spice up their  looks and favor cybernetic augmentations, often installed at  a cousin's bustling street clinic. Ysoki enjoy expressing their  personality through fashion, layering clothing items and  accessories into a jumbled fusion.
