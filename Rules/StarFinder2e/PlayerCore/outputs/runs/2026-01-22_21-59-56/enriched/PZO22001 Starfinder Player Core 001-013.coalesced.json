More importantly, Starfinder is a game where your  character's choices determine how the story unfolds.\n\nStarfinder takes place following the Gap, an era of collective  memory loss. Explore a galaxy full of magic and mystery,  from the vibrant worlds and bustling satellites of the Pact  Worlds to cosmic wonders and warring civilizations in Near  Space or the distant regions of the perilous Vast. A Starfinder  character's adventures might take them to sleepless  megacities full of technological marvels, rugged alien planets  prowled by dangerous monsters, or magical installations  orbiting distant stars. Worlds of endless possibility await!",

A complete  story can be as short as a single session, often referred to as  a \"one-shot,\" or it can stretch for multiple sessions, forming a  campaign that might last for months or even years. If the GM  enjoys telling the story and the players are entertained, the  game can go on for as long as you like.\n\nA session can be mostly action, featuring battles with  ferocious monsters, hacking computer terminals and magitech  traps, and the completion of heroic missions.

If any other rule gets in the way of your fun,  you can alter or ignore it to fit your story as long as  your group agrees. The true goal of Starfinder is for  everyone to enjoy themselves.\n\nit could include unionizing miners on an asteroid teeming  with megafauna, infiltrating a galactic empire's military, or  bargaining with enigmatic spectras for a starship's speedy  passage through the Drift.

A  saving throw is a check attempted against the DC of the  spell or special ability targeting your character. There are  three types of saving throws, and a character's proficiency  in each says a great deal about what they can endure. A  **Fortitude** saving throw is used when your character's  health or vitality is under attack, such as from poison or  disease. A **Reflex** saving throw is called for when your  character must dodge away from danger, usually something  that affects a large area, such as the burst of vines from a  *verdant code *spell or the fiery explosion from a grenade.  Finally, a **Will **saving throw is often your defense against  spells and effects that target your character's mind, such as  a *phantasmal fleet* or *vibe check* spell.
