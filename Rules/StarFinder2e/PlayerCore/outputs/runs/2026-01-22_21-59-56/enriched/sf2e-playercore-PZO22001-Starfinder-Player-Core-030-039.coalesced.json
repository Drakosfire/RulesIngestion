Knowing the setting  of the world you intend to play in can help flesh out your character, or even give rise to new ideas for  a character that you hadn't considered.\n\nThe Starfinder Roleplaying Game rules come with their own  default setting: the galaxy known as Desna's Path. The galaxy  is full of wonder and peril, advanced technology, magic,  meddling deities, and countless new worlds to explore.  Starfinder's setting combines elements of science fiction with  classic fantasy elements while taking inspiration from the  modern world. All kinds of characters can find a place in the  galaxy, and there are many galactic events, people, and plot  hooks that a player can base a character around.",

About 300 years  ago, something erased an entire era from memory. Records  for this forgotten era simply don't exist. People who lived  through the Gap experienced a collective amnesia about its  events. Magic can't bridge the broken timeline, and even the  gods won't reveal what occurred. During this nebulous time  that might have spanned a few years or several centuries,  societies changed, the planet Golarion disappeared, and  Absalom Station was built with the *Starstone* at its core. A  few years later, Drift travel came to the galaxy, and a new age  of interstellar adventure began.",
