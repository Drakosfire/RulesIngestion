You can install an armor upgrade  with the Install Upgrade activity, which takes 10 minutes to  perform. Unlike many other types of equipment, armor upgrades  run on kinetic energy created by your body's motion, and they  don't need external batteries. They function only when installed  in armor you're wearing properly.",

Projectile weapons can also use ammunition created  using precious materials that can add additional benefits,  such as bypassing specific resistances of enemies or adding  new traits to your attacks. Weapons can also be constructed  using precious materials for 10 times the price of a piece of  projectile ammunition plus an extra price for the bulk of the  weapon. Grenades and missiles that deal physical damage can  be crafted using precious materials at three times the price.  The benefits of precious material conferred to attacks apply  only to ammunition, melee, and thrown weapons that deal  physical damage. A melee weapon that can deal different types  of damage, such as the phase cutlass, only applies the benefits  of the precious material when the weapon deals physical  damage. An item can be made with no more than one precious  material, and only an expert in Crafting can create it. Some rare  materials require master or even legendary proficiency.",
