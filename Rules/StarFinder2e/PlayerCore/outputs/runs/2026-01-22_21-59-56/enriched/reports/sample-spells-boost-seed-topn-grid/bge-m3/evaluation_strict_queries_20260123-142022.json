This casts the  spell at the rank you know the spell, not the rank of the  higher slot. The spell doesn't have any heightened effects,  so it's usually not a very efficient use of your magic outside  of highly specific circumstances. For instance, if your party  was having trouble with an invisible enemy, and you had  *revealing light* in your repertoire but had already spent all  of your 2nd-rank spell slots, it might be worth it to use a  3rd-rank spell slot to cast the spell, even though it'd have no  heightened benefit.?",
