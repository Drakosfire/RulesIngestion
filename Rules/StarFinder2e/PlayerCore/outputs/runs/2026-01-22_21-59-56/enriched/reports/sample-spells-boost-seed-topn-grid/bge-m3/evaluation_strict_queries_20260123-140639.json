As technology  improves and creates mass-market marvels rivaling  what was once only possible for a powerful spellcaster,  magic is more static, with arcane universities,  occult societies, and religious orders preserving  ancient techniques and tomes into the modern  era. Many specialty tech items incorporate hybrid  magitechnology, and most spellcasters carry a backup  gun or other tech gear on them for when they run  out of spells. Magic and technology coexist, but most  spellcasters use analog spellcasting, and blending the  two together to create a hybrid item requires training.  Only a few spellcasters mix magic with technology they're seen as mavericks by most established magical  institutions.
