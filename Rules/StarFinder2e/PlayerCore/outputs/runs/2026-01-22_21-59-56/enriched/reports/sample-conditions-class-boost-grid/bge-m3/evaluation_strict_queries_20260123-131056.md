### Query 69
- Text: What is the rule about Average hearing is an imprecise sense—it can't detect the  full range of detail that a precise sense can. You can usually  sense a creature automatically with an imprecise sense, but  it has the hidden condition instead of the observed condition.  It might be undetected by you if it's using Stealth or in an  environment that distorts the sense, such as a noisy room  in the case of hearing. In those cases, you have to use the  Seek basic action to detect the creature. At best, an imprecise  sense can be used to make an undetected creature (or one  you didn't even know was there) merely hidden—it can't make  the creature observed.?

### Query 158
- Text: What is the rule about Effects can change the number of actions you can use on  your turn, or whether you can use actions at all. The slowed  condition, for example, causes you to lose actions, while the  quickened condition causes you to gain them. Conditions are  detailed in the appendix on pages 435–441. Whenever you  lose a number of actions—whether from these conditions or  in any other way—you choose which to lose if there's any  difference between them. For instance, the *haste* spell makes  you quickened, but it limits what you can use your extra  action to do. If you lost an action while *haste* was active, you  might want to lose the action from *haste* first since it's more  limited than your normal actions.?

This works like targeting a hidden creature, but the  flat check and attack roll are both rolled in secret by the GM.  The GM won't tell you why you missed—whether it was due  to failing the flat check, rolling an insufficient attack roll, or  choosing the wrong square. The GM might allow you to try  targeting an undetected creature with some spells or other  abilities in a similar fashion. Undetected creatures are subject  to area effects normally.?

A skill feat still counts to satisfy the requirement  of the dedication. There are also class archetypes that can  modify your class's abilities as soon as 1st level.

- Text: What is the rule about Spellcasting archetypes always grant the ability to cast  cantrips in their dedication, and then they have a basic  spellcasting feat, an expert spellcasting feat, and a master  spellcasting feat. These feats share their name with the  archetype; for instance, the witchwarper's master spellcasting  feat is called Master Witchwarper Spellcasting. All spell slots  you gain from spellcasting archetypes are subject to the  restrictions within the archetype. For instance, the mystic  archetype allows you to pick a connection when you take  its dedication feat. If you pick a connection granting divine  spells, the archetype then grants you spell slots you can use  only to cast divine spells you prepare as a mystic, even if you  are a witchwarper with occult spells in your repertoire.?
