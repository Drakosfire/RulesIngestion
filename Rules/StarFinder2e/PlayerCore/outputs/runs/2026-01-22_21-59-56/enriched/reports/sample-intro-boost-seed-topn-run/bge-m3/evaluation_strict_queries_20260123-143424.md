### Query 273
- Text: What is the rule about Lashuntas are natural psychics with adaptive genetics who  traditionally develop into one of two heritages at puberty:  damayas or korashas. They have a well-earned reputation for  being charismatic, driven, and self-reflective, with a perpetual  desire for growth—both in terms of personal advancement and  self-improvement. This cultural push to know oneself, embrace  one's strengths, surpass one's past successes, and strive for evergreater goals drives lashuntas to value education, focus, and  training as well as to explore new discoveries, technologies, and  modes of thought. While many lashuntas today still fulfill the  traditional role of the enlightened warrior or the consummate  scholar, time and shifting social norms have gifted lashuntas  the freedom to branch out in countless ways, developing their  own interests, hobbies, and genetic expressions, with no regard  to their heritage or societal standing.?

### Query 277
- Text: What is the rule about Around puberty, lashuntas traditionally choose whether  to express damaya or korasha genetics—a decision that  determines their physical development and influences their  potential societal roles. Lashuntas achieve their choice through  a combination of psychic rituals and gene therapy. Today,  many young lashuntas have chosen to tread their own path  and abstain from this choice, instead becoming "unbound."  Unbound lashuntas defy traditional roles and labels, and they  might express traits and innate proclivities common to both  of or neither of these groups. A growing minority of lashuntas  instead pushes for further genetic diversification and aims to  express unique or long-buried genetic permutations, pioneering  entirely new chosen heritages. Whether such experimentation  will prove fruitful remains to be seen.?
