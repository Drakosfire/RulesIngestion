- Text: What is the rule about After Triune's Signal connected cultures across the  Universe, the peoples of the galaxy have learned more  than ever before about the Universe's composition  thanks to science and technology. As technology  improves and creates mass-market marvels rivaling  what was once only possible for a powerful spellcaster,  magic is more static, with arcane universities,  occult societies, and religious orders preserving  ancient techniques and tomes into the modern  era. Many specialty tech items incorporate hybrid  magitechnology, and most spellcasters carry a backup  gun or other tech gear on them for when they run  out of spells. Magic and technology coexist, but most  spellcasters use analog spellcasting, and blending the  two together to create a hybrid item requires training.  Only a few spellcasters mix magic with technology they're seen as mavericks by most established magical  institutions. Technomancers and spellcasters who  have learned to command machines or connect with  computers using magic blaze a trail few have explored.?

- Text: What is the rule about In addition, many spells have additional specific benefits  when they are heightened, such as increased damage. These  extra benefits are described at the end of the spell's stat  block. Some heightened entries specify one or more ranks  at which the spell must be prepared or cast to gain these  extra advantages. Each of these heightened entries states  specifically which aspects of the spell change at the given  rank. Read the heightened entry only for the spell rank you're  using or preparing; if its benefits are meant to include any of  the effects of a lower-rank heightened entry, those benefits  will be included in the entry.?

- Text: What is the rule about As a spontaneous caster, you can also choose to cast  a lower-rank spell using a higher-rank spell slot without  heightening it or knowing it at a higher rank. This casts the  spell at the rank you know the spell, not the rank of the  higher slot. The spell doesn't have any heightened effects,  so it's usually not a very efficient use of your magic outside  of highly specific circumstances. For instance, if your party  was having trouble with an invisible enemy, and you had  *revealing light* in your repertoire but had already spent all  of your 2nd-rank spell slots, it might be worth it to use a  3rd-rank spell slot to cast the spell, even though it'd have no  heightened benefit.?

### Query 43
- Text: What is the rule about Focus spells are a special type of spell attained directly from  a specific source, such as a field of study, connection to a  mystical force, or exposure to an alternate reality. You can  learn focus spells only through special class features or feats,  rather than choosing them from a spell list. Furthermore, you  cast focus spells using a special pool of Focus Points—you can't  prepare a focus spell in a spell slot or use your spell slots to  cast focus spells; similarly, you can't spend your Focus Points  to cast spells that aren't focus spells. Even some classes that  don't normally grant spellcasting can grant focus spells. The  title of a focus spell's stat block says "Focus" instead of "Spell",  and the spell has the focus trait.?

### Query 89
- Text: Summarize If a creature engages with an illusion in a way that would  prove it's not what it seems, the creature might know that an  illusion is present, but it still can't ignore the illusion without  successfully disbelieving it. Disbelieving a visual illusion makes  it and those things it blocks seem hazy and indistinct, which  might block vision enough to leave the other side concealed.

You  can still wear and use your gear, which changes size (if  necessary) to match your new form. If items leave your  person, they return to their usual size.?

### Query 299
- Text: What is the rule about The illusion can cause damage by making the target believe  the illusion's attacks are real, but it cannot otherwise directly  affect the physical world. If the illusory creature hits with a  Strike, the target takes 3d4 mental damage. The illusion's  Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to  the image of the monster—for example, if an illusory Large  dragon deals only 5 damage—the GM might allow the target  to attempt an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the  spell. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the  target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if  the illusion wields a doshko and attacks a creature resistant to  piercing damage, the creature would take less mental damage.  However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or  trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The  GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.?

### Query 419
- Text: What is the rule about Spells with the summon trait can conjure creatures,  typically ones with a particular trait. Such creatures can  be found in *Alien Core* and similar books. Unless noted  otherwise, the creature must be common, it gains the  summoned trait (page 299), and it must appear in an  unoccupied space in range large enough to contain it.  The highest level of creature the spell can summon  depends on the rank of the spell, as listed below. The  spell can still summon a creature of a lower level if you  so choose. These rules apply only to spells that have  the summon trait; other spells that call or conjure items  or beings but that don't have the trait, like *summon * *instrument*, work as explained in the spell.?
