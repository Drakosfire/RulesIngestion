### Query 32
- Text: What is the rule about Effects can change the number of actions you can use on  your turn, or whether you can use actions at all. The slowed  condition, for example, causes you to lose actions, while the  quickened condition causes you to gain them. Conditions are  detailed in the appendix on pages 435–441. Whenever you  lose a number of actions—whether from these conditions or  in any other way—you choose which to lose if there's any  difference between them. For instance, the *haste* spell makes  you quickened, but it limits what you can use your extra  action to do. If you lost an action while *haste* was active, you  might want to lose the action from *haste* first since it's more  limited than your normal actions.?

For example, the quickened  condition you get from the *haste* spell lets you spend  an extra action each turn to Stride or Strike, but you  couldn't use the extra action for an activity that  includes a Stride or Strike. As another example, if you  used an action that specified, "If the next action you use  is a Strike," an activity that includes a Strike wouldn't  count because the next thing you're doing is starting an  activity, not using the Strike basic action.?

### Query 271
- Text: What is the rule about Spellcasting archetypes always grant the ability to cast  cantrips in their dedication, and then they have a basic  spellcasting feat, an expert spellcasting feat, and a master  spellcasting feat. These feats share their name with the  archetype; for instance, the witchwarper's master spellcasting  feat is called Master Witchwarper Spellcasting. All spell slots  you gain from spellcasting archetypes are subject to the  restrictions within the archetype. For instance, the mystic  archetype allows you to pick a connection when you take  its dedication feat. If you pick a connection granting divine  spells, the archetype then grants you spell slots you can use  only to cast divine spells you prepare as a mystic, even if you  are a witchwarper with occult spells in your repertoire.?

### Query 417
- Text: Summarize A creature or object within darkness is hidden or undetected  unless the seeker has darkvision or a precise sense other  than vision. A creature without darkvision or another means  of perceiving in darkness has the blinded condition while in  darkness, though it might be able to see illuminated areas beyond  the darkness. If a creature can see into an illuminated area, it can  observe creatures within that illuminated area normally. After  being in darkness, sudden exposure to bright light might make  you dazzled for a short time, as determined by the GM.

### Query 426
- Text: What is the rule about A character also has many vague senses—ones that can alert  you that something is there but aren't useful for zeroing in on  it to determine exactly what it is. The most useful of these  for a typical character is the sense of smell. At best, a vague  sense can be used to detect the presence of an unnoticed  creature, making it undetected. Even then, the vague sense  isn't sufficient to make the creature hidden or observed.?

- Text: What is the rule about A creature that's hidden is only barely perceptible. You only  know what space it occupies. Perhaps the creature just used  the Hide action. Your target might be behind some obstruction,  where you can see some movement but can't determine an  exact location. Maybe you've been blinded or the creature is  invisible, but you used the Seek basic action to determine its  general location based on hearing alone. Regardless of the  specifics, you're off-guard to a hidden creature.?

- Text: What is the rule about Targeting an undetected creature is difficult. If you suspect  there's a creature around, you can pick a square and attempt  an attack. This works like targeting a hidden creature, but the  flat check and attack roll are both rolled in secret by the GM.  The GM won't tell you why you missed—whether it was due  to failing the flat check, rolling an insufficient attack roll, or  choosing the wrong square. The GM might allow you to try  targeting an undetected creature with some spells or other  abilities in a similar fashion. Undetected creatures are subject  to area effects normally.?

- Text: What is the rule about A concealed creature is in mist, within dim light, or amid  something else that obscures sight but isn't a physical  barrier. When you target a creature that's concealed  from you, you must attempt a DC 5 flat check before  you roll to determine your effect. If you fail, you don't  affect the target. The concealed condition doesn't change  which of the main categories of detection apply. A  creature in a light fog bank is still observed even though  it's concealed.?
