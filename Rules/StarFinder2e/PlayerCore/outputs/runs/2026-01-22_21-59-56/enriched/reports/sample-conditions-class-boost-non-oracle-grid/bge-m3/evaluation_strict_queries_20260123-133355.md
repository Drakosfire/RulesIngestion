### Query 32
- Text: What is the rule about Effects can change the number of actions you can use on  your turn, or whether you can use actions at all. The slowed  condition, for example, causes you to lose actions, while the  quickened condition causes you to gain them. Conditions are  detailed in the appendix on pages 435–441. Whenever you  lose a number of actions—whether from these conditions or  in any other way—you choose which to lose if there's any  difference between them. For instance, the *haste* spell makes  you quickened, but it limits what you can use your extra  action to do. If you lost an action while *haste* was active, you  might want to lose the action from *haste* first since it's more  limited than your normal actions.?

### Query 266
- Text: What is the rule about Some archetypes include a list of "Additional Feats" that  appear in other sources. The list includes each feat's level,  which might be different than normal when gained from the  archetype. You can take the feat as an archetype feat of that  level, meaning it counts toward the number of feats required  by the archetype's dedication feat. When selected this way, a  feat that normally has a class's trait (such as the soldier trait)  doesn't have that class trait.?

For instance, the mystic  archetype allows you to pick a connection when you take  its dedication feat. If you pick a connection granting divine  spells, the archetype then grants you spell slots you can use  only to cast divine spells you prepare as a mystic, even if you  are a witchwarper with occult spells in your repertoire.?

### Query 424
- Text: What is the rule about Average hearing is an imprecise sense—it can't detect the  full range of detail that a precise sense can. You can usually  sense a creature automatically with an imprecise sense, but  it has the hidden condition instead of the observed condition.  It might be undetected by you if it's using Stealth or in an  environment that distorts the sense, such as a noisy room  in the case of hearing. In those cases, you have to use the  Seek basic action to detect the creature. At best, an imprecise  sense can be used to make an undetected creature (or one  you didn't even know was there) merely hidden—it can't make  the creature observed.?

### Query 429
- Text: Summarize While a human might have a difficult time making creatures  out in dim light, an android can see those creatures just fine.  And though androids have no problem seeing on a dimly  lit street, their vision can't penetrate complete darkness,  whereas a pahtra's can. Special senses allow a creature to  ignore or reduce the effects of the undetected, hidden, or  concealed conditions (described on pages 425–426) when it  comes to situations that foil average vision.

- Text: What is the rule about In most circumstances, you can sense creatures without  difficulty and target them normally. Creatures in this state  are observed. Observing requires a precise sense, which for  most creatures means sight. If you can't observe the creature,  it's either hidden, undetected, or unnoticed, and you'll need  to factor in the targeting restrictions. Even if a creature is  observed, it might still be concealed.?

### Query 482
- Text: What is the rule about Targeting an undetected creature is difficult. If you suspect  there's a creature around, you can pick a square and attempt  an attack. This works like targeting a hidden creature, but the  flat check and attack roll are both rolled in secret by the GM.  The GM won't tell you why you missed—whether it was due  to failing the flat check, rolling an insufficient attack roll, or  choosing the wrong square. The GM might allow you to try  targeting an undetected creature with some spells or other  abilities in a similar fashion. Undetected creatures are subject  to area effects normally.?

You suspect that with  the witchwarper's Speed of 25 feet, they probably moved 15  feet toward an open door.
