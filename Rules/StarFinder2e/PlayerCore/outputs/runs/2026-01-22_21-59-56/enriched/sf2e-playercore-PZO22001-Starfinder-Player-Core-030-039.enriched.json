The *Idari* traveled slowly at a fraction  of light speed, so by the time the ship arrived, Akiton had  already boomed and declined, but a massive population still  lived there. Unwilling to invade an occupied world, the *Idari*'s  ancestral ruling Doyenate decided to remain in the system  for a time and prepare for another journey. The *Idari *has full  Pact World status, meaning residents are free to move to  other worlds in the system, and immigrants are welcomed in  turn. The *Idari* has its own manufacturing Crucibles, farms,  water reservoirs, and natural preserves teeming with animals  and plants cultivated from the ancient kasatha home world.  A popular political movement gaining traction among the  Doyenate advocates for the *Idari* to leave the system.",
