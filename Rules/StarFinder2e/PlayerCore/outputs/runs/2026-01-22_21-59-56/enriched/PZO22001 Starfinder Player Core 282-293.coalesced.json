Engineers have developed fascinating  new fusions of magic and technology, often called magitech or hybrid tech, while artisans have  revived magical crafting techniques from eras long past. Shopping for new magic gear is as simple  as searching the infosphere, visiting a corporate storefront, or browsing an antique mall. Curiosity  shops and flea markets are full of everything from knockoffs of the latest cutting-edge inventions to  precious relics preserved from the ancient past, if you know where to look.",
