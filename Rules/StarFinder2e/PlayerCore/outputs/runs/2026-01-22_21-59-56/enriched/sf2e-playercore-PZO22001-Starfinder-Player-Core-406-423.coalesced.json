Actions are most  closely measured and restricted during the encounter mode of play, but even when it isn't important for  you to keep strict track of actions, they remain the way in which you interact with the game world.\n\nYou'll need to track your actions carefully in an encounter. At  the start of each turn you take in an encounter, you regain 3  actions and 1 reaction to spend that round. (Regaining your  actions is described in detail on page 428.) You can spend  your actions in many different ways.\n\nThere are four types of actions: single actions, activities,  reactions, and free actions.",

Melee Strikes rely on reach. Your reach is  typically 5 feet, but weapons with the reach trait can extend  this. Larger creatures can have greater reach; for instance, a  crest-eater has a 10-foot reach. Unlike with measuring most  distances, 10-foot reach can reach 2 squares diagonally.  Reach greater than 10 feet is measured normally: 20-foot  reach can reach 3 squares diagonally, 30-foot reach can  reach 4, and so on.",
