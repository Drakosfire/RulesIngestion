This  is where most of the intense action takes place, and it's  most often used for combat or other high-stakes situations.  The GM typically switches to encounter mode by calling on  the players to \"roll for initiative\" to determine the order in  which all the actors take their turns during the encounter.  Time is then divided into a series of rounds, each lasting  roughly 6 seconds in the game world. Each round, player  characters, other creatures, and sometimes even hazards or  events take their turn in initiative order. At the start of a  participant's turn, they gain the use of a number of actions  (typically 3 in the case of PCs and other creatures) as well  as a special action called a reaction. These actions, and what  you do with them, are how you affect the world within an  encounter. The full rules for playing in encounter mode start  on page 427.?",
