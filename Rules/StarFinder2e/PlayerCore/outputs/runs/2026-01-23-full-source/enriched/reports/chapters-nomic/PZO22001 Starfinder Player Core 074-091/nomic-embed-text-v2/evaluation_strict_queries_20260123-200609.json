Your scales count as medium armor in the plate armor group.  They grant a +3 item bonus to AC, have a Dex cap of +1, a check  penalty of \u20132, and a Strength threshold of +3, and have the  comfort and exposed traits. This item bonus increases to +4 at  5th level. You can wear a flight suit, but you can't wear other  armor. You can etch armor runes (see page 226 of *Pathfinder* *GM* *Core*) onto your scales, but you can't install armor upgrades.?",
