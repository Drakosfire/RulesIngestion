If an action has the secret trait, the GM  rolls the check for you and informs you of the effect  without revealing the result of the roll or the degree of  success. The GM rolls secret checks when your knowledge  about the outcome is imperfect, like when you're searching  for a hidden creature or object, attempting to deceive  someone, translating a complex alien language, or decoding  encrypted data. This way, you as the player don't know  things that your character wouldn't. This rule is the default  for actions with the secret trait, but the GM can choose not  to use secret checks if they would rather some or all rolls  be public.?",
