If the illusory creature hits with a  Strike, the target takes 3d4 mental damage. The illusion's  Strikes are nonlethal. If the damage doesn't correspond to  the image of the monster\u2014for example, if an illusory Large  dragon deals only 5 damage\u2014the GM might allow the target  to attempt an immediate Perception check to disbelieve the  spell. Any relevant resistances and weaknesses apply if the  target thinks they do, as judged by the GM. For example, if  the illusion wields a doshko and attacks a creature resistant to  piercing damage, the creature would take less mental damage.  However, illusory damage does not deactivate regeneration or  trigger other effects that require a certain damage type. The  GM should track illusory damage dealt by the illusion.?",
