This chapter presents the various equipment that you can purchase  during character creation. You can usually find these items for sale in most cities and other large  settlements.\n\nYour character starts out with 150 credits to spend on any  common items from this chapter. Credits are a galactic  currency used to barter and trade for goods in the Starfinder  setting. Items with an uncommon rarity can be purchased  only if you have special access from abilities you selected  during character creation or your GM gives you permission  to purchase them.",

Interplanetary business is conducted through  the trade of credits standardized by the strenuous banking  regulations of various interstellar powers and organizations,  like the Church of Abadar.

In cases where a civilization hasn't converted over, there  are often agreements in place to determine the relative worth  of a credit compared to local currency.

These protections allow you to survive for a few days if  you must make repairs to the hull of a starship, explore an airless  alien world, or endure exposure to an environmental breach while  trapped inside a space station.

While using  your armor's environmental protections, your armor can protect  you from the dangerous environmental effects of a vacuum  and can facilitate self-contained breathing. This allows you to  survive and breathe while within a thick or thin atmosphere, in  a vacuum, or while submerged in liquid (the safety seals and  rebreather offer no protection from the effects of damaging  liquids, such as acid or lava).
