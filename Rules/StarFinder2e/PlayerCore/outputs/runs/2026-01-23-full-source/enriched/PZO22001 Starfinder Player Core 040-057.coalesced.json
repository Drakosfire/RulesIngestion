You'll also select  a number of languages for your character. Once chosen, your  ancestry and background can't be changed.\n\nThis chapter is divided into four parts.",

Most were  created in specialized birthing sites called foundries.

Androids need to eat  and sleep, but they don't reproduce, don't age, and have no  innate concept of gender\u2014though many express humanoid  gender identities or shift fluidly between them. Most  androids voluntarily release their bodies after a century or  so, allowing new souls to inhabit them in a process called  renewal.",

Centuries later, they arrived aboard the worldship  *Idari* to find a thriving planet already inhabited by multitudes  of other species. Most kasathas decided to stay on board the  *Idari*, while others peacefully emigrated to the many planets  of the Pact Worlds, where their scientific and metaphysical  knowledge are welcomed additions to the diverse star  system.
