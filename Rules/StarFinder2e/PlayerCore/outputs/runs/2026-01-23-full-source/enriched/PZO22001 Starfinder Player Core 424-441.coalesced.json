You can usually make an educated guess as to which  locations are best to check and move at half speed, but if you  want to be thorough and guarantee you checked everything,  you need to travel at a Speed of no more than 300 feet per  minute, or 150 feet per minute to ensure you check everything  before you walk into it. You can always move more slowly  while Searching to cover the area more thoroughly, and the  Expeditious Search feat increases these maximum Speeds. If  you come across a secret door, item, or hazard while Searching,  the GM will attempt a free secret check to Seek to see if you  notice the hidden object or hazard. In locations with many  objects to search, you have to stop and spend significantly  longer to search thoroughly.",
