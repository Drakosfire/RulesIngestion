# CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

Starfinder is a science fantasy tabletop roleplaying game (RPG) where you and a group of friends gather to play out a story of daring adventurers exploring a galaxy filled with impossible magic, amazing technology, and fantastical alien cultures. More importantly, Starfinder is a game where your character's choices determine how the story unfolds.

Starfinder takes place following the Gap, an era of collective memory loss. Explore a galaxy full of magic and mystery, from the vibrant worlds and bustling satellites of the Pact Worlds to cosmic wonders and warring civilizations in Near Space or the distant regions of the perilous Vast. A Starfinder character's adventures might take them to sleepless megacities full of technological marvels, rugged alien planets prowled by dangerous monsters, or magical installations orbiting distant stars. Worlds of endless possibility await!

# WHAT IS A ROLEPLAYING GAME?
WHAT IS A ROLEPLAYING GAME?

A roleplaying game is an interactive story where one player, the Game Master (GM), sets the scene and presents challenges, while other players take the roles of player characters (PCs) and attempt to overcome those challenges. Danger comes in the form of monsters, hostile tech, and alien environments, but Starfinder conflicts also involve political schemes, puzzles, interpersonal drama, and more.

The game is typically played in a group of four to seven players, with one of those players serving as the group's GM. The GM prepares, presents, and presides over the game's setting and story, posing challenges and playing adversaries, allies, and bystanders alike. As each scene flows, every player contributes to the story, responding to situations according to the personality and abilities of their character. Combined with preassigned statistics, dice rolls add an element of chance to the game and determine whether characters succeed or fail at actions.

# THE FLOW OF THE GAME
THE FLOW OF THE GAME

Starfinder is played in sessions during which players gather in person or online for a few hours to play the game. A complete story can be as short as a single session, often referred to as a 'one-shot,' or it can stretch for multiple sessions, forming a campaign that might last for months or even years. If the GM enjoys telling the story and the players are entertained, the game can go on for as long as you like.

A session can be mostly action, featuring battles with ferocious monsters, hacking computer terminals and magitech traps, and the completion of heroic missions. Alternatively,

# THE FIRST RULE
THE FIRST RULE

The first rule of Starfinder is that this game is yours . Use it to tell the stories you want to tell, be the character you want to be, and share exciting adventures with friends. If any other rule gets in the way of your fun, you can alter or ignore it to fit your story as long as your group agrees. The true goal of Starfinder is for everyone to enjoy themselves.

it could include unionizing miners on an asteroid teeming with megafauna, infiltrating a galactic empire's military, or bargaining with enigmatic spectras for a starship's speedy passage through the Drift. Ultimately, it's up to you and your group to determine what kind of game you're playing, from exploration of uncharted space to an intergalactic political drama, or anything in between.

# THE PLAYERS
THE PLAYERS

Everyone involved in a Starfinder game is a player, including the Game Master, but for the sake of simplicity, 'player' usually refers to participants other than the GM. Before the game begins, players invent a history and personality for their characters, using the rules to determine their characters' statistics, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. The GM might limit the options available to the players during character creation, but these restrictions should be discussed ahead of time so everyone can create interesting heroes. In general, the only limits to character concepts are the players' imaginations and the GM's guidelines.

During the game, players describe the actions their characters take and roll dice, using their characters' abilities. The GM resolves the outcome of these actions. Some players enjoy acting out (or roleplaying) what they do as if they were their characters, while others describe their characters' actions as if they were telling a story. Do whatever feels best!

If this is your first experience with a roleplaying game, it's recommended that you take on the role of a player to familiarize yourself with the rules and the galaxy.

# DICE
DICE

Starfinder requires a set of polyhedral dice. Each die has a different number of sides-four, six, eight, or more. When these dice are mentioned in the text, they're indicated by a 'd' followed by the number of sides on the die. Starfinder uses 4-sided dice (or d4), 6-sided dice (d6), 8-sided dice (d8), 10-sided dice (d10), 12-sided dice (d12), and 20-sided dice (d20). If you need to roll multiple dice, a number before the 'd' tells you how many. For example, '4d6' means you should roll four dice, all 6-sided. If a rule asks for d%, you generate a number from 1 to 100 by rolling two 10-sided dice, treating one as the tens place and the other as the ones place.

# THE GAME MASTER
THE GAME MASTER

While the other players create and control their characters, the Game Master (or GM) is in charge of the story and setting. The GM describes all the situations the player characters experience in an adventure, considers how the actions of player characters affect the story, and interprets the rules along the way. The Game Master uses the rules and advice found in Starfinder GM Core .

The GM can create a new adventure-crafting a narrative, selecting monsters, and assigning rewards on their ownor they can instead rely on a published adventure, using it as a basis for the session and modifying it as needed to accommodate their individual players and the group's style of play. Some GMs run games that combine original and published content, mixing both together to form a new story.

Being the GM is a challenge, requiring you to adjudicate the rules, narrate the story, and juggle other responsibilities. But it can also be very rewarding and worth all the work required to run a good game. If it's your first time running a game, remember that the only thing that matters is that everyone, including you, has a fun time. Everything else will come naturally with practice and patience.

# GAMING IS FOR ALL
GAMING IS FOR ALL

Whether you're the GM or a player, participating in a tabletop roleplaying game includes a social contract: everyone's gathered together to have fun. For many, roleplaying is a way to escape the troubles of everyday life. Be mindful of everyone at the table and what they want out of the game; when a group gathers for the first time, they should talk about what they hope to experience at the table, as well as any topics they'd like to avoid. Everyone should understand that elements might come up that make some players feel uncomfortable or even unwelcome, and everyone should agree to respect those boundaries during play. That way, everyone can enjoy the game together.

Starfinder is a game for everyone, regardless of their age, gender, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or any other identities and life experiences. It's the responsibility of all of the players, not just the GM, to make sure the game is fun and welcoming for everyone.

# TOOLS OF PLAY
TOOLS OF PLAY

In addition to this book, there are a few things you will need to play Starfinder. These supplies can be found at your local hobby shop or online at paizo.com .

Character Sheet: Each player needs a character sheet to create their character and to record what happens to them during play. You can find a character sheet in the back of this book and online as a free PDF.

Dice: The players and GM need at least one set of polyhedral dice, although most participants bring their own. Six-sided dice are quite common, but all the dice in the set can be found at hobby game stores or online. See the Dice sidebar for an overview of the different kinds of dice and how they are discussed in the text.

Adventure: Every group needs an adventure to play, whether it's designed by the GM or found in a published resource. You can find a variety of exciting adventures and even entire Adventure Path campaigns at paizo.com .

Starfinder Alien Core: From the vanguard components of the Swarm to immensely powerful starmetal dragons, monsters are a common threat that the PCs might face, and each type has its own statistics and abilities. These can be found in Starfinder Alien Core , an invaluable book for GMs. Monster statistics can also be found online for free at paizo. com/prd .

Maps and Miniatures: The chaos of combat can be difficult to imagine, so many groups use maps to represent the battlefield. These maps are marked with a 1-inch grid, and each square usually represents 5 feet in the game. Miniatures and illustrated tokens called pawns are used to represent the characters and the adversaries they face.

# BASICS OF PLAY
BASICS OF PLAY

Before creating your first character or adventure, you should understand a number of basic concepts used in the game. New concepts are presented in bold to make them easy to find, but this chapter is only an introduction to the basics of play. The complete game rules are defined in later chapters, and the Glossary and Index in the back of this book will help you find the specific rules you need.

# DEFINING CHARACTERS
DEFINING CHARACTERS

In Starfinder, the players take on the role of player characters (PCs) , while the Game Master portrays nonplayer characters (NPCs) and monsters . While PCs and NPCs are both important to the story, they serve very different purposes in the game. PCs are the protagonists-the narrative is about them-while NPCs are allies, contacts, adversaries, and villains. That said, PCs, NPCs, and monsters share several characteristics.

Level is one of the most important statistics of the game, as it conveys the approximate power and capabilities of every individual creature. PCs range in level from 1st, at the start of

the character's adventuring career, to 20th, the very height of power. As the characters overcome challenges, defeat foes, and complete adventures, they accumulate Experience Points (XP) . Every time a character amasses 1,000 XP, they go up a level, gaining new abilities so they can take on even greater challenges. A 1st-level PC might face off against a rampant assembly ooze or a hardlight scamp, but at 20th level, that same character might be able to decimate an army with a supermassive black hole or trade blows with a god.

In addition to level, characters are defined by attributes , which measure raw potential and are used to calculate most of their other statistics. There are six attributes in the game. Strength represents a character's physical might, while Dexterity represents agility and their ability to avoid danger. Constitution indicates a character's overall health and well-being. Intelligence represents raw knowledge and problem-solving ability, while Wisdom measures a character's insight and their ability to evaluate a situation. Finally, Charisma indicates charm, persuasiveness, and force of personality. Attribute modifiers for ordinary creatures range from as low as -5 to as high as +5, with +0 representing average human capabilities. High-level characters can have attribute modifiers that range much higher than +5. An attribute modifier above the average increases your chance of success at related tasks, while those below the average decrease your chance.

Your player character is also defined by some key choices you make. The first choice is a PC's ancestry , representing the character's parents and heritage, such as barathu, human, or vesk. Next up is the PC's background , which describes their upbringing, from sly smuggler to famous icon. Finally, and most importantly, a PC's class defines the majority of their aptitudes and abilities, like a soldier's training to put down heavy fire or a witchwarper's knack for altering reality.

In addition to these key choices, PCs also have a number of feats -individual abilities selected during character creation and as the character increases in level. Every feat has a type to denote where its explanation can be found (for example, android feats can be found in the android ancestry) and its theme (mystic feats, for example, grant abilities that deal with spells). Finally, characters have skills that measure their ability to treat wounds, use computers, pilot vehicles, and perform other common tasks.

# THE GALAXY AS A PARTICIPANT
THE GALAXY AS A PARTICIPANT

Aside from characters and monsters, the galaxy of Starfinder itself can be a force at the table and in the narrative. While the presence of the larger setting can sometimes be an obvious hazard, such as when a firestorm rages through an alien jungle, the setting can also act in subtler, smaller ways. Traps and treasures are just as important in many tales as monstrous foes. To help you understand these game elements, many of them use the same characteristics as characters and monsters. For example, most environmental hazards have a level that indicates how dangerous they are, and the level of a magic item gives you a sense of its overall power and impact on a story.

take turns describing what their characters attempt to do, while the GM determines the outcome, with everyone working together to create the story. The GM also describes the environment, other characters' actions, and events. For example, the GM might announce that the PCs' home world is under attack by the Swarm. The characters might fight off the first strike, then track the invaders back to a planetoid in the Vast-just as a jinsul raiding party arrives! The PCs have the choice of battling Swarm emganats, fending off jinsul invaders, or both. Whatever they decide, their success depends on their choices and their die rolls.

A single narrative-including the setup, plot, and conclusion-is called an adventure . A series of adventures creates an even larger narrative called a campaign . An adventure might take several sessions to complete, whereas a campaign might take months or even years!

# CREATING A NARRATIVE
CREATING A NARRATIVE

Characters and their choices create the story of Starfinder, but how they interact with each other and the galaxy around them is governed by rules. So, while you might decide that your character steals a starship and takes off on a perilous interstellar journey, your character's chance of success is determined by their abilities, the choices you make, and the roll of the dice.

The GM determines the premise and background of most adventures, although character histories and personalities should also play a part. Once a game session begins, the players

# PLAYING THE GAME
PLAYING THE GAME

In a Starfinder game, three modes of play determine the pacing of each scene in the story. Most of your character's time is spent in exploration , uncovering mysteries, solving problems, and interacting with other characters. The galaxy is filled with danger, however, and characters often find themselves in an encounter , fighting hostile parties when negotiations go south and battling fearsome alien monsters. Finally, time moves quickly when the characters enjoy downtime , a respite from the galaxy's troubles and a chance to rest and train for future activities. Throughout an adventure, gameplay moves between these three modes many times, as needed for the story. The more you play the game, the more you'll see that each mode has its own play style, but moving from mode to mode has a few hard boundaries.

During the game, your character will face situations where the outcome is uncertain. A character might need to navigate while inside the Drift, survive in an alien desert, or sneak past a corporate security robot, all of which are dangerous tasks with a price for failure. In such cases, the acting character (or characters) is asked to attempt a check to determine whether or not they succeed. A check is usually made by rolling a single 20-sided die (a d20) and adding a number based on the relevant attribute. In such cases, rolling high is always good.

Once a check is rolled, the GM compares the result to a target number called the difficulty class (DC) to determine the outcome. If the result of the check is equal to or greater than the DC, the check is successful. If it's lower, the check is a failure. Beating the DC by 10 or more is referred to as a critical success , which usually grants an especially positive outcome. Similarly, failing the check by 10 or more is a critical failure (sometimes called a fumble). This sometimes results in additional negative effects. You also often score a critical success by rolling a 20 on the die when attempting a check (before adding anything). Likewise, rolling a 1 on the die when attempting a check often results in a critical failure. Note that not all checks have a special effect on a critical success or critical failure, and such results should be treated just like an ordinary success or failure instead.

For example, while aboard a starship traveling to a faraway world, your character might find a faster route through an uncharted asteroid field. You decide to go for it, but the GM declares this a dangerous task and asks you to roll a Piloting skill check (since navigation is covered by the Piloting skill). On your character sheet, you see that your character has a +8 modifier for such checks. Rolling the d20, you get an 18, for a total of 26. The GM compares this to the DC (which was 16) and finds that you got a critical success (since the result exceeded the DC by 10). Your character charts a safe path around every asteroid without scratching the hull. Had you gotten a result less than 26 but equal to or greater than 16, your character's route would've taken your ship halfway through the debris field. Had your result been less than 16, your character might have gotten lost among the spinning chunks of rock and ice or, on a critical failure (6 or less), crashed the ship into one of them!

Checks like this are the heart of the game and are rolled all the time, in every mode of play, to determine the outcome of tasks. While the roll of the die is essential, the statistic you add to the roll (called a modifier ) often makes the difference between success and failure. Every character is made up of many such statistics governing what the character is good at, each consisting of a relevant attribute modifier plus a proficiency bonus , and sometimes modified further by other factors, such as bonuses or penalties from gear, spells, feats, magic items, and other special circumstances.

Proficiency is a simple way of assessing your character's general level of training and aptitude for a given task. It's broken into five different ranks: untrained , trained , expert , master , and legendary . Each rank grants a different proficiency bonus. If you're untrained at a statistic, your proficiency bonus is +0; you must rely solely on the raw potential represented by your attribute modifier. If your proficiency rank for a statistic is trained, expert, master, and legendary, your bonus equals your character's level plus another number based on the rank (2, 4, 6, and 8, respectively). Proficiency ranks are part of almost every statistic in the game.

# EXPLORATION
EXPLORATION

Most of the time, your character will explore an environment, interact with other characters, travel from place to place, and overcome challenges. This is called exploration. Gameplay is relatively free-form during exploration, with players responding to the narrative whenever they have an idea of what to do next. Ransacking an abandoned warehouse and riding a crowded gravtrain are both examples of exploration.

Leaving a city aboard an enercopter, spotting signs of a marauding kyokor, predicting the path the kyokor might take through the badlands, and convincing local wasteland scavengers to help lure the monster away from the city's outskirts are all examples of things that might occur during exploration.

Throughout this mode of play, the GM asks the players what their characters are doing as they explore. This is important in case a conflict arises. If combat breaks out, the tasks the PCs undertook while exploring might give them an edge or otherwise inform how the combat begins.

# ENCOUNTERS
ENCOUNTERS

During your adventures, there will be times when a simple skill check is not enough to resolve a challenge-when vicious monsters or ruthless enemies attack your character and the only choice is to fight back. In Starfinder, this is called an encounter. Encounters usually involve combat, but they can also be used in situations where timing is critical, such as during a chase or when avoiding hazards. Encounters might also involve socializing or negotiating in a tense situation.

While exploration is handled in a free-form manner, encounters are more structured. The players and GM roll initiative to determine who acts in what order. The encounter occurs over a number of rounds , each of which is equal to about 6 seconds of time in the world of the game. During a round, each participant takes a turn . When it's your turn to act, you can use up to three actions . Most simple things, such as drawing a weapon, moving a short distance, opening a door, or firing a laser pistol, use a single action to perform. There are also activities that use more than a single action to perform; these are often special abilities from your character's class and feats. One common activity in the game is casting a spell, which usually uses two actions.

Free actions , such as dropping an object, don't count toward the three actions you can take on your turn. Finally, each character can use up to one reaction during a round. This special type of action can be used even when it's not your turn, but only in response to certain events, and only if you have an ability that allows it. Envoys, for example, can select a feat that lets them use their reaction to warn an ally about incoming fire.

Attacking another creature is one of the most common actions in combat and is done by using the Strike action. This requires an attack roll-a kind of check made against the Armor Class (AC) of the creature you're attacking. Strikes can be made using weapons, spells, or even parts of a creature's body, like a claw, fist, or tail. You add a modifier to this roll based on your proficiency rank with the type of attack you're using, your attributes, and any other bonuses or penalties based on the situation. The target's AC is calculated using their proficiency rank in the armor they're wearing and their Dexterity modifier. An attack deals damage if it hits, and rolling a critical success results in the attack dealing double damage!

# PLAYER CORE
PLAYER CORE

You can use more than one Strike action on your turn, but each additional attack after the first becomes less accurate. This is reflected by a multiple attack penalty that starts at -5 on the second attack, but increases to -10 on the third. There are many ways to reduce this penalty, and it resets at the end of your turn.

If your character finds themself the target of a magical mind skewer or caught in the path of area fire from a flamethrower, you'll be called on to attempt a saving throw , representing your character's ability to avoid danger or otherwise withstand an assault to their mind or body. A saving throw is a check attempted against the DC of the spell or special ability targeting your character. There are three types of saving throws, and a character's proficiency in each says a great deal about what they can endure. A Fortitude saving throw is used when your character's health or vitality is under attack, such as from poison or disease. A Reflex saving throw is called for when your character must dodge away from danger, usually something that affects a large area, such as the burst of vines from a verdant code spell or the fiery explosion from a grenade. Finally, a Will saving throw is often your defense against spells and effects that target your character's mind, such as a phantasmal fleet or vibe check spell. For all saving throws, a success lessens the harmful effect, and scoring a critical success usually means your character escapes unscathed.

Attacks, spells, hazards, and special abilities frequently either deal damage to a character or impose one or more conditions -and sometimes both. Damage is subtracted from a creature's Hit Points (HP) -a measure of health-and when a creature is reduced to 0 HP, it falls unconscious and may die! A combat encounter typically lasts until one side has been defeated, and while this can mean retreat or surrender, it often happens because one side is dead or dying. Conditions can hinder a creature for a time, limiting the actions they can use and applying penalties to future checks. Some conditions are even permanent, requiring a character to seek out powerful magic or advanced technologies to undo their effects.

# DOWNTIME
DOWNTIME

PCs don't have to spend every waking moment adventuring. They might also recover from wounds, craft specialty goods, explore a new location and recruit allies, surf the infosphere, or work a part-time job. In Starfinder, this is called downtime, and it allows time to pass quickly while characters work on long-term tasks or objectives. Most characters can work in downtime, earning a few credits, but those with the right skills can also spend time crafting or inventing new equipment. Characters can also use downtime to retrain, replacing one character choice with another to reflect their evolving priorities. They might also research a problem, learn new spells, enjoy a city's nightlife, or even command a starship fleet or run a space station! Downtime might be split between roleplaying scenes, discussions of your character's (or party's) long-term plans, and skill checks meant to represent days or weeks of progress toward those goals.

# KEY TERMS
KEY TERMS

There are a number of important terms that you'll need to know as you create your first character or adventure. Some of the most important terms mentioned on previous pages are also included here for reference.

# Action
Action

During encounters, each creature gets three actions during their turn. These actions are spent to attack, interact with objects, move, and use special abilities. Actions available to all characters can be found in Chapter 8.

# Ancestry
Ancestry

An ancestry is the broad family of people that a character belongs to. Ancestry determines a character's starting Hit Points, languages, senses, and Speed, and it grants access to ancestry feats. Ancestries can be found in Chapter 2.

# Armor Class (AC)
Armor Class (AC)

All creatures in the game have an Armor Class. This score represents how hard it is to hit and damage a creature. It serves as the Difficulty Class for hitting a creature with an attack.

# Attack
Attack

When a creature tries to harm another creature, it makes a Strike or uses some other attack action. Most attacks are Strikes made with a weapon, but a character might Strike with their fist, grapple or shove with their appendages, or attack with a spell.

# Attribute Modifier
Attribute Modifier

Each creature has six attribute modifiers: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each of these numbers represents a creature's raw potential and general training. Attributes are described in full later in this chapter.

# Background
Background

A background represents what a character experienced before they became an adventurer. Each background grants a feat and training in one or more skills. You can read more about backgrounds in Chapter 2.

# Bonuses and Penalties
Bonuses and Penalties

Bonuses and penalties apply to checks and certain statistics. There are several types of bonuses and penalties. If you have more than one bonus of the same type, you use only the highest bonus. Likewise, you use only the worst penalty of each type.

# Check
Check

When a character attempts an action where success is uncertain, they may roll a check. This is a roll of one 20-sided die plus the named proficiency bonus. For example, a Perception check would add your Perception proficiency.

# Class
Class

A class represents the adventuring profession chosen by a character. A character's class determines most of their proficiencies, grants the character Hit Points each time they gain a new level, and gives access to a set of class feats. Classes appear in Chapter 3.

# Condition
Condition

An ongoing effect that changes how a character can act, or that alters some of their statistics, is called a condition. The rules for the basic conditions used in the game can be found in the Conditions Appendix at the back of this book.

# Currency
Currency

The most common currency in the game is credits. Characters begin play with 150 credits to spend on equipment.

# Feat
Feat

A feat is an ability you can select for your character due to their ancestry, background, class, general training, or skill training. Some feats grant the ability to use special actions, while others make your existing actions more effective.

# Game Master (GM)
Game Master (GM)

The Game Master is the player who adjudicates the rules and narrates the various elements of the Starfinder story and world that the other players explore. The GM uses the rules found in Starfinder GM Core .

# The Galaxy
The Galaxy

Starfinder is set in the Pact Worlds, a system of allied planets that was once home to the lost world Golarion, though many adventures explore the wider galaxy. More information about the galaxy can be found on page 30 and in Starfinder Galaxy Guide and Starfinder GM Core .

# Hit Points (HP)
Hit Points (HP)

Hit Points represent the amount of punishment a creature can take before it falls unconscious and begins dying. Damage decreases Hit Points on a 1-to-1 basis, while healing restores Hit Points at the same rate.

# Initiative
Initiative

At the start of an encounter, all creatures involved roll for initiative to determine the order in which they act. The higher the result of its roll, the earlier a creature gets to act. Initiative and combat are described in Chapter 8.

Level

A level is a number that measures something's overall power. Player characters have a level, ranging from 1st to 20th, representing their level of experience. Monsters, NPCs, hazards, diseases, and poisons have levels ranging from -1 to 30 that measure the danger they pose. An item's level, usually within the range of 0 to 20 but sometimes higher, indicates its power and suitability as treasure.

# Nonplayer Character (NPC)
Nonplayer Character (NPC)

A nonplayer character, controlled by the GM, interacts with players and helps advance the story.

# Perception
Perception

Perception measures your character's ability to notice hidden objects or unusual situations, and it usually determines how quickly the character springs into action in combat. It's described in full in Chapter 9.

# Player Character (PC)
Player Character (PC)

This is a character created and controlled by a player.

# Proficiency
Proficiency

Proficiency is a system that measures a character's aptitude at a specific task or quality, and it has five ranks: untrained, trained, expert, master, and legendary. Proficiency gives you a bonus that's added when determining the following modifiers and statistics: AC, attack rolls, Perception, saving throws, skills, and the effectiveness of spells. If you're untrained, your proficiency bonus is +0. If you're trained, expert, master, or legendary, your proficiency bonus equals your level plus 2, 4, 6, or 8, respectively.

# Rarity
Rarity

Some elements of the game have a rarity to denote how often they're encountered in the game world. Rarity primarily applies to equipment and magic items, but spells, feats, and other rules elements also have a rarity. If no rarity appears in the traits of an item, spell, or other game element, it' s of common rarity. Uncommon options are available only to those who have special training, grew up in a certain culture, or come from a particular part of the galaxy. This can be explained with an 'Access' entry, explaining criteria for characters to choose it as a common option. Rare options are difficult to find and are usually given out only by the GM, while unique ones are literally one-of-a-kind in the game. The GM might alter the way rarity works or change the rarity of individual items to suit the story they want to tell.

# Roleplaying
Roleplaying

Describing a character's actions, often while acting from the perspective of the character, is called roleplaying. When a player speaks or describes action from the perspective of a character, they are 'in character.'

# PLAYER CORE
PLAYER CORE

# Round
Round

A round is a period of time during an encounter in which all participants get a chance to act. A round represents approximately 6 seconds in game time.

# Saving Throw (Save)
Saving Throw (Save)

When a creature is subject to a dangerous effect that must be avoided, it attempts a saving throw to mitigate the effect. You attempt a saving throw automatically-you don't have to use an action or a reaction. Unlike for most checks, the character who isn't acting rolls the d20 for a saving throw, and the creature who is acting provides the DC.

There are three types of saving throws: Fortitude (to resist diseases, poisons, and physical effects), Reflex (to evade effects a character could quickly dodge), and Will (to resist effects that target the mind and personality).

# Skill
Skill

A skill represents a creature's ability to perform certain tasks that require instruction or practice. All characters are trained in certain skills due to their background and class. Skills are fully described in Chapter 4. Each skill includes ways anyone can use that skill even if untrained, as well as uses that require a character to be trained in the skill.

# Speed
Speed

Speed is the distance a character can move using a single action, measured in feet.

# Spell
Spell

Spells are magical effects created by performing mystical incantations and gestures. Casting a spell is an activity that usually uses two actions. Each spell specifies what it targets, the actions needed to cast it, its effects, and how it can be resisted. If a class grants spells, the basics of that ability are provided in the class description in Chapter 3, while the spells themselves are detailed in Chapter 7.

Spells have ranks ranging from 1st to 10th, which measure their power; characters and monsters can usually cast only a certain number of spells of any given rank.

# Trait
Trait

A trait is a keyword that conveys additional information about a rules element, such as which ancestry a feat belongs to or the rarity of an item. Often, a trait indicates how other rules interact with an ability, creature, item, or another rules element that has that trait.

All the traits used in this book appear in the Glossary and Index beginning on page 442.

# Turn
Turn

During the course of a round, each creature takes a single turn according to initiative. A creature can typically use up to three actions during its turn.

STARFINDER

# EXAMPLE OF PLAY
EXAMPLE OF PLAY

The following example is presented to give you a better idea of how Starfinder is played. In this adventure, Thurston is the GM. Jenny is playing Obozaya, an aggressive vesk soldier; Jessica is playing Dae, a flashy pahtra solarian; Mike is taking on the role of Zemir, a human witchwarper who's seen it all in every reality; and Dustin is playing Chk Chk, a moody shirren mystic who worships Zon-Shelyn. The party has chosen to fly their starship to investigate a disturbance near a Drift navigation beacon.

| Thurston: | Your ship speeds through the swirling colors and half-formed shapes of the Drift. You're getting close to the coordinates, but chunks of rock, ice, and metal scrap float ahead of you, blocking your path. | | --- | --- | | Zemir (Mike): | 'Time to chart a course through this mess.' I take a deep breath, grip the controls, and pilot the ship into the debris field. | | Thurston: | Roll your Piloting check. | | Zemir (Mike): | I rolled a 5, so with my +7 modifier I got a 12. 'I'm gonna need more coffee for this.' | | Thurston: | Zemir turns just in time to avoid crashing into a massive asteroid, but he loses the path he was following. | | Chk Chk (Dustin): | I perform a dramatic reading of a poem I wrote about finding inspiration in failure through our Group Chat. |

Group Chat is a mystic ability that lets Chk Chk and anyone in his bond communicate telepathically with each other. Most party banter happens in Group Chat.

Obozaya (Jenny):

'Thanks, Chk Chk.' I chug some coffee and try again. 13! I've got a +7 to Piloting so

that's a 20!

The ship

zooms safely

through the

debris until the beacon you were sent to investigate looms in the viewport. It's a

cylindrical silver satellite twice the size of your ship lit by blinking red lights, anchored

in the churn of hyperspace by the prayers of Triune's tech priests.

I fly the ship closer so we can investigate.

Up close, you notice an armored ysoki clinging to the side of the satellite.

'Zemir, can you get us closer?' I'm going to send the ysoki a telepathic message to calm

them down while we figure out a way to help. 'Don't let fear erase you; let the void

embrace you.' Is there any response?

None. Only silence.

I don't like that. 'Hey Obo, can I borrow your jetpack?'

'Only if you don't break it.'

Dae, are you installing Obozaya's jetpack into your armor?

Paws off! I'll do it with Quick Install.

Quick Install is a skill feat that lets Obozaya Install an Upgrade in 1 minute, instead of the 10 minutes this activity would normally take.

| Dae (Jessica): | I head for the airlock, then strike a pose as I step into space. 'Hey Chk Chk, make sure you're recording this!' | | --- | --- | | Thurston: | Now you're untethered. Are you free floating? | | Dae (Jessica): | Nope! I activate the jetpack and fly toward the ysoki. | | Obozaya (Jenny): | 'Careful, Dae. I don't want to have to clean you off the side of that Drift beacon.' | | Chk Chk (Dustin): | 'A splash of red would look great on that silver metal. But not if it's Dae's blood! Don't look at me like that, Zemir.' | | Dae (Jessica): | 'No worries, bestie. After we rescue the ysoki, we can give the beacon a glow up.' | | Thurston: | Dae, up close, you notice that the ysoki's spacesuit is covered in blood, and that there's a crack in their helmet. Underneath, their face is frozen in a mask of terror. | | Zemir (Mike): | 'Dae, it's time to get back to the ship.' | | Dae (Jessica): | 'You don't have tell me twice, Z!' I grab the ysoki and drag them back to the ship. | | Thurston: | Dae, when you get back to the airlock, you notice blood smears on the floor that weren't there when you left. | | Dae (Jessica): | 'Heads up. I think something got onto the ship.' I leave the ysoki in the airlock and sprint toward the bridge. | | Thurston: | Dae stops 60 feet down the hall from the bridge door. The rest of you hear dull scraping outside. It sounds like something's shuffling toward you. | | Obozaya (Jenny): | I pull out my machine gun and move in front of my allies, facing the door. Bring it. | | Zemir (Mike): | I stand up from the pilot's console and draw my laser pistol. | | Chk Chk (Dustin): | I draw my painglaive and check my bond to make sure Dae's safe. |

Dae is part of Chk Chk's mystic bond, so he knows Dae is alive and not far away.

| Thurston: | The autodoor stutters open. A vesk and a human wearing tattered spacesuits loom in the doorway. Milky eyes bulge out of their rotting faces. Roll for initiative! | | --- | --- |

Everyone rolls Perception for their initiative. Mike gets a total of 20. Jessica rolls 12, Dustin rolls 16, and Jenny rolls 10. Thurston rolls for the driftdead, getting a 19 and 14. He secretly rolls for the ysoki in the airlock and gets a 13. Thurston records all these totals, putting everyone in order from highest to lowest. Two of the player characters have abilities that activate when they roll initiative. Zemir's Quantum Pulse lets him activate

his quantum field, an area of warped reality he controls. He chooses to center it between the enemy and himself. Solarians can Attune as a free action when they roll initiative, so Dae chooses to become graviton attuned and manifests their solar weapon, a battle ribbon of crackling void energy.

| Thurston: | Zemir, you're up first. | | --- | --- | | Zemir (Mike): | Excellent. For my first action, I spend 1 Focus Point to cast warp terrain . | | Thurston: | Which effect do you choose? | | Zemir (Mike): | I choose difficult terrain. My quantum field fills with twisted metal and chunks of rock from a reality where we didn't make it past that asteroid safely. For my next action, I shoot the vesk with my new laser pistol! |

Mike rolls a 12 and adds +8, due to Zemir's training with simple weapons, for a total of 20. Thurston consults his notes to confirm the driftdead has an AC of 16.

# Thurston:
Thurston:

You hit! Roll for damage.

Mike rolls 2d6 for his tactical laser pistol and deals 7 fire damage, then marks 1 charge as expended from his gun's magazine.

| Zemir (Mike): | For my third action, I Take Cover behind a rock in my quantum field. | | --- | --- | | Thurston: | The rotting vesk recoils as laser fire hits it, then it shoots a bolt of void energy at you. |

Thurston rolls a 22. Zemir's AC is 21, but he gains a +2 circumstance bonus from standard cover. The attack misses. The driftdead fires another bolt at him. Thurston rolls a 23, which hits Zemir's AC of 21, and he takes 6 void damage. Then, the driftdead lumbers toward Obozaya. Each square of difficult terrain counts twice, so the driftdead's Speed of 25 feet isn't enough to get to her this round.

# Chk Chk (Dustin):
Chk Chk (Dustin):

I cast vibe check . I'm broadcasting an angry poem about my childhood into the human's mind: 'Despite all my bile, I am still just a bug in a vial!' That's two actions. Then, I'll Transfer Vitality to Zemir and heal him for 7 Hit Points.

Thurston rolls a 17 for the human driftdead's Will save against Chk Chk's spell DC of 21. The driftdead fails and must use its next action to attack the nearest creature. The angry driftdead goes next and attacks its vesk ally, dealing 4 damage.

| Thurston: | The walking corpse turns its anger on you, Chk Chk. It lurches toward you and lashes out with clawed hands. Does a 23 hit you? | | --- | --- | | Chk Chk (Dustin): | 'I welcome the pain!' Yes, that hits me. |

Thurston rolls for slashing damage from the driftdead's claws and gets a total of 10.

# Dae (Jessica):
Dae (Jessica):

# PLAYER CORE
PLAYER CORE

My turn! I Stellar Rush down the hall and into the bridge. Black lightning crackles around me and drags both enemies toward me when I dash past them.

Stellar Rush is a solarian feat that lets Dae Stride twice with a +10 circumstance bonus to their movement speed. When Dae finishes both Strides, enemies within 15 feet attempt a Fortitude save to determine if they're pulled toward Dae. Dae's Class DC is 21. Thurston rolls for both driftdead and gets a 6 and 12. Both fail and are pulled toward Dae, ending in adjacent squares. Stellar Rush has the cycle trait, meaning Dae's attunement changes to photon after they complete the action.

# Dae (Jessica):
Dae (Jessica):

My black battle ribbon bursts into solar flame. I pirouette and attack the vesk, making sure the camera drone can see all my moves. I rolled a 26.

The driftdead's AC is 16, so Dae's Strike is a critical hit and Jessica doubles her damage roll, for a total of 20 out of its 40 Hit Points.

| Thurston: | The creature snarls as the ribbon of starlight lashes across its torso, singeing its ruined spacesuit. Obozaya, it's your turn. | | --- | --- | | Obozaya (Jenny): | 'Thanks for the setup, Dae!' I Auto-Fire at both enemies. The human is closest to me, so she's my primary target. |

Obozaya's Auto-Fire hits all creatures in a 20-foot cone, which includes Dae, but because of training from her bombard fighting style she avoids hurting her ally. Instead of Obozaya rolling to Strike, creatures in the area roll a Reflex save to find out how much damage they take. The vesk driftdead succeeds at its save and takes 9 damageexactly enough to knock it out! The other fails and takes 18 damage from the barrage.

# Obozaya (Jenny):
Obozaya (Jenny):

'Hahahahaha!' That's Menacing Laughter for my third action. Oh, and don't forget, the enemy is suppressed.

Obozaya rolls an Intimidation check, adding her +11 modifier. She rolls a 1, so the driftdead isn't shaken. The driftdead is suppressed by Obozaya's attack, taking a -1 circumstance penalty on attack rolls and a -10-foot status penalty to Speed until the start of her next turn.

| Thurston: | One foe falls to Obozaya's barrage. There's a sudden lurch that feels like being pulled into the Drift as the dead ysoki from the airlock phases through the floor and lunges at Dae claws first! | | --- | --- |

That is the end of the first round of combat. The second round begins immediately after this, using the same initiative order as before and including the new foe. The fight is just beginning…
