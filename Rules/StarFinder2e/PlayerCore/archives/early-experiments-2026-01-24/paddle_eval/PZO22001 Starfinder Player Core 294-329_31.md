Traditions divine, occult 

Area 30-foot emanation 

Defense Will 

You sense the presence of thinking creatures around you.You detect the presence or absence of thoughts from conscious creatures that have Intelligence modifiers of -3 or higher. You can choose to ignore the thoughts of creatures you're familiar with so they don't interfere with your detection of other thoughts. The spell can penetrate some barriers, but 3 feet of dirt or wood,1 foot of stone, 1inch of metal, a thin sheet of lead, or any force barrier blocks it.Creatures who are immune to mental effects are immune to detection by this spell.



Heightened (4th) You detect the number of thinking minds and whether or not the creatures are telepathic. Creatures with telepathy have louder thoughts than creatures who don't have telepathy and might be able to sense your intrusion, at the GM's discretion.

ILLUSION MANIPULATE SUBTLE 

Traditions arcane, occult 

Range touch; Targets 1 creature 

Duration 10 minutes 

You shroud a creature from others' senses. The target becomes undetected, not just to sight but to all senses,allowing the target to count as invisible no matter what precise and imprecise senses an observer might have. It's still possible for a creature to find the target by Seeking,looking for disturbed dust, hearing gaps in the sound spectrum, or finding some other way to discover the presence of an otherwise-undetectable creature.

## DISGUISE MAGIC 

SPELL1

CONCENTRATE LLUSION MANIPULATE 

Traditions arcane, occult 

Cast 1 minute 

Range 30 feet; Targets 1 item or spell effect 

Duration until your next daily preparations 

You alter how an item's or spell's magical aura appears to effects like detect magic. You can hide the auras entirely,have an item register as a common item of lower level, or make a spell register as a common spell of the same or lower rank. You can Dismiss the spell.



A caster using detect magic or read aura of a higher rank than disguise magic can attempt to disbelieve the illusion using the skill matching the tradition of the spell (Arcana for arcane, Religion for divine, Occultism for occult, or Nature for primal). Further attempts by the same caster get the same result as the initial check to disbelieve.

Heightened (2nd] You can Cast this Spell on a creature,disguising all items and spell effects on it.

## DISINTEGRATE 

SPELL 6

ATTACK CONCENTRATE  MANIPULATE 

Traditions arcane 

Range 120 feet; Targets 1 creature, unattended object, or force construct 



Defense AC and basic Fortitude 

A black tracer bolt flies toward your target, and upon making contact intensifies into a powerful destructive beam. Make a spell attack against the target. If you hit an object or force construct (such as a wall of force), it's destroyed with no save unless it's an artifact or similarly powerful. A single casting can destroy no more than a 10foot cube of matter.



If you hit a creature, it takes 12d10 damage (no damage type) with a basic Fortitude save. lf you critically hit, the target gets a result one degree of success worse than the outcome of its Fortitude save.A creature reduced to 0 HP is blasted to fine powder; its gear remains.



Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d10.

## DISPELMAGIC 

SPELL 2

CONCENTRATE  MANIPULATE 

Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal 

Range 120 feet; Targets 1 spell effect or unattended magic item 



You unravel the magic behind a spell or effect. Attempt a counteract check against the target (page 301).If you successfully counteract a magic item, it becomes a mundane item of its type for 10 minutes. This doesn't change the item's non-magical properties. If the target is an artifact or similar item, you automatically fail.
