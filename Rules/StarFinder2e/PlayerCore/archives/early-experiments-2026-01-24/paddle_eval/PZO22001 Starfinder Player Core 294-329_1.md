Whether it comes inthe form of eldritch artifacts,otherworldly beings,orwitchwarpers altering reality with strange spells,magic brings fantasy and wonder to Starfinder.This chapter explains how spells work andhow spellcasters prepare and cast their spells.

## SPONTANEOUSSPELLS 

If you're a spontaneous spellcaster-such as a mystic-you choose which spell from your spell repertoire that you're using a spell slot for at the moment you decide to cast it. This provides you with more freedom in your spellcasting, but you have fewer spells in your spell repertoire, as determined by your character level and class. When you make your daily preparations, all your spell slots are refreshed, but you don't get to change the spells in your repertoire.

## HEIGHTENEDSPELLS 

Both prepared and spontaneous spellcasters can cast a spell at a higher spell rank than that listed for the spell. This is called heightening the spell. A prepared spellcaster can heighten a spell by preparing it in a higher-rank slot than its normal spell rank, while a spontaneous spellcaster can heighten a spell by casting it using a higher-rank spell slot,INTRODUCTION

# CHAPTER 7: SPELLS 

（

Even with the widespread presence of technology,spellcasters can be found in every corner of the galaxy.Some spellcasters draw magic from other realities, some from their mystical connections to cosmic forces, and others rewrite the underlying code of the universe to cast their spells.



With special gestures and utterances,a spellcaster can call forth mystic energies, warp the mind, protect themself against danger, or even create something from nothing Each class has its own method of learning, preparing,and casting spells, and every individual spell produces a specific effect, so learning new spells gives a spellcaster an increasing array of options to accomplish their goals.

## SPELL SLOTS 

Characters of spellcasting classes can cast a number of spells each day; the spells you can cast in a day are referred to as spell slots. At 1st level, a character has only a small number of 1st-rank spell slots per day,but as you advance in level, you gain more spell slots of higher rank. A spell's rank indicates its overall power, from 1to 10.



## PREPAREDSPELLS 

If you're a prepared spellcaster-such as a technomancer (see Starfinder Tech Core)-you must spend time each day preparing spells for that day. At the start of your daily preparations, you select a number of spells of different spell ranks, determined by your character level and class.Your spells remain prepared until you cast them or until you prepare spells again.



Each prepared spell is expended after a single casting,so if you want to cast a particular spell more than once in a day, you need to prepare that spell multiple times. The exception to this rule is for spells with the cantrip trait; once you prepare a cantrip, you can cast it as many times as you want until the next time you prepare spells. See page 296for more information on cantrips.



You might gain an ability that allows you to swap prepared spells or perform other aspects of preparing spells at different times throughout the day, but only your daily preparation counts for the purpose of effects that last unti the next time you prepare spells.



## SPELLCASTING IN STARFINDER 

After Triune's Signal connected cultures across the Universe, the peoples of the galaxy have learned more than ever before about the Universe's composition thanks to science and technology.As technology improves  and creates mass-market marvels rivaling what was once only possible for a powerful spellcaster,magic  is  more static,with arcane universities,occult societies,and religious orders preserving ancient  techniques and tomes into the modern era. Many specialty tech items incorporate hybrid magitechnology, and most spellcasters carry a backup gun or other tech gear on them for when they run out of spells.Magic and technology coexist, but most spellcasters use analog spellcasting, and blending the two together to create a hybrid item requires training.Only a few spellcasters mix magic with technologythey're seen as mavericks by most established magical institutions.  Technomancers  and spellcasters who have learned to command machines or connect with computers using magic blaze a trail few have explored.
