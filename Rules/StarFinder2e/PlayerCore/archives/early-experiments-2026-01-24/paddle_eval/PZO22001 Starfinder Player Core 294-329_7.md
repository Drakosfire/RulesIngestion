precisely aim a ray or otherwise make an accurate attack. A spell attack roll is compared to the target's AC. Spell attack rolls benefit from any bonuses or penalties to attack rols,including your multiple attack penalty, but not any special benefits or penalties that apply only to weapon or unarmed attacks. Spell attacks don't deal any damage beyond what's listed in the spell description.



In rare cases, a spell might have you make some other type of attack, such as a weapon Strike. Such attacks use the normal rules and attack bonus for that type of attack.

## I DENTIFYING SPELLS 

Sometimes you need to identify a spell, especially if its effects aren't obvious right away. If you notice a spell being cast, and you have that spell in your repertoire or prepared it that day (even if you already cast it), you automatically know what the spell is, including the rank to which it is heightened.



If you want to identify a spell but don't have it prepared or in your repertoire, you must spend an action on your turn attempting to identify it using Recall Knowledge. You typically notice a spell being cast due to its sensory spell manifestations (page 298). Identifying long-lasting spells that are already in place requires using ldentify Magic instead of Recall Knowledge because you don't have the advantage of watching the spell being cast.

## COUNTER△CTING 

Some spells, such as dispel magic, can be used to eliminate the effects of other spells. At least one creature, object, or manifestation of the spell you are trying to counteract must be within range of the spell that you are using. You attempt a counteract check (page 43) using your Charisma (or other spellcasting attribute modifier] and your proficiency bonus for spell attack rolls.



## HOSTILE △CTIONS 

Sometimes spells prevent a target from using hostile actions, or the spell ends if a creature uses any hostile actions. A hostile action is one that can harm or damage another creature, whether directly or indirectly, but not one that a creature is unaware could cause harm. For instance,casting sonic scream into a crowd would be a hostile action,but opening a door and accidentally freeing a horrible monster wouldn't be. The GM is the final arbitrator of what is a hostile action.



## SETTING TRIGGERS 

If a spell is meant to respond only to certain events or under certain conditions, it might require you to set a trigger. This is a simple sensory cue that causes the spell to activate. The spell activates as a reaction when the spell's sensor obseryes something that fits its trigger. Depending on the spell, the trigger might be the presence of a type of creature, such as "creatures with six or more tentacles,"or it could be an observed action,such as "whenever someone enters the spell's area."

Disguises and illusions fool the spell as long as they appear to match its parameters. For a spell to detect something visually,the spell's origin point must have line of sight.Darkness doesn't prevent this, but invisibility does, as does a successful Stealth check to Hide against the spell's DC). For auditory detection, line of sight isn't necessary,though the sound must be audible at the spell's origin point.A Stealth check to Sneak can fool the sensor.

## WALLS 

Spells that create walls, such as wall of plasma, list the depth, length, and height of the wall, also specifying how it can be positioned. Some walls can be shaped; you can manipulate the wall into a form other than a straight line,choosing its contiguous path square by square. The path of a shaped wall can't enter the same space more than once, but it can double back so one section is adjacent to another section of the wall 



## RE△DING SPELLS 

Each spell uses the following format. Entries appear only when applicable, so not all spells will have every entry described here. The spell's name line also lists the type of spell if it's a cantrip or focus spell, as well as the rank.

## SPELL NAME 1

## TRAITS 

## SPELL (RANK)

Tradition This entry lists the magical traditions the spell belongs to. Some feats or other abilities might add a spell to your spell list even if you don't follow the listed traditions.



Cast Spells that take longer than a single turn to cast include this entry to list the time required, such as "1 minute." If the spell has a cost, locus, requirements,or a trigger, that information is also listed in this section.

Range, Area, and Targets This entry lists the range of the spell, the area it affects, and the targets it can affect, if any. If none of these entries are present, the spell affects only the caster.



Defense and Duration If a spell allows the target to attempt a saving throw or use their AC to defend against it, the type of defense appears here (see page 300 for details).A Duration entry appears if the spell has one. A spell that doesn't list a duration takes place instantaneously, and anything created by it persists after the spell.

A horizontal line follows defense and duration, and the effects of the spell are described after this line.This section might also detail the possible results of a saving throw:critical success, success,failure, and critical failure.

Heightened (rank) If the spell has special effects when heightened (page 295),those effects appear at the end of the stat block.
