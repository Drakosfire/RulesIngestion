## STARFINDER 

If a spell's caster dies or is incapacitated during the spell's duration, the spell remains in effect until its duration ends,using the caster's initiative order.



## SUSTAININGSPELLS 

If the spell's duration is "sustained." it lasts until the end of your next turn unless you use the Sustain action (page 411)on that turn to extend the duration of that spell.

## LONGDURATIONS 

If a spell's duration says it lasts until your next daily preparations, on the next day you can refrain from preparing anew spell in that spell's slot.(Ifyou are a spontaneous caster,you can instead expend a spell slot during your preparations.)Doing so extends the spell's duration until your next daily preparations. This effectively Sustains the spell over a long period of time. If you prepare a new spell in the slot or don't expend a spell slot),the spell ends. You can't do this if the spell didn't come from one of your spell slots.If you are dead or otherwise incapacitated at the 24-hour mark after the time you Cast the Spell or the last time you extended its duration,the spell ends, Spells with an unlimited duration last until counteracted or Dismissed. You don't need to keep a spell slot open for these spells.

their character's condition (such as when a character is paralyzed, unconscious, or even dead).



Spells that affect multiple creatures in an area can have both an Area entry and a Targets entry. A spell that has an area but no targets listed usually affects all creatures in the area indiscriminately.



## LINEOF EFFECT 

You usually need an unobstructed path to the target of a spell, the origin point of an area, or the place where you create something with a spell. More information on line of effect can be found on page 418.



## DURATIONS 

The duration of a spell is how long the spell efect lasts.Spells that last for more than an instant have a Duration entry. A spell might last until the start or end of a turn, for some number of rounds, for minutes, or even longer. If a spell's duration is given in rounds, the number of rounds remaining decreases by 1at the start of each of the spellcaster's turns ending when the duration reaches O.



Some spells have effects that remain even after the spell's magic is gone.Any ongoing effect that isn't part of the spell's duration entry isn't magical. For instance, a spell such as sunburst that creates a brief. intensely bright flash of light might blind someone for a time, eyen permanently. This blindness couldn't be counteracted because it is not itself magical (though it might be cured by other magic, such as sound body).



Some spells can be dismissed, ending the duration early.This reguires the caster or target to use the Dismiss action (page 411).



## DEFENSES 

If a spell allows the target to attempt a saving throw or use their ACtoend againt i,tetpeofdefnei lisin stat block. Any details on the particular results and timing of the save appear in the text unless the entry specifies a basic saving throw, which follows a standard rule. If a spell allows a defense only under certain circumstances or at a certain time, the Defenses entry is omitted, since the text needs to explain it in more detail. Whenever a spell allows a saving throw, it uses the caster's spell DC, and one that allows AC as a defense typically requires a spell attack. More information on how to calculate your spell DC and spell attack modifier appears starting on page 394.



## BASIC SAVING THROWS 

Ifaspell's Defensesentry spcifies a"basic"savingtrow,the spell's potential effects all relate to the damage listed in the spell's description, The target takes no damage on a critical success, half damage on a success, full damage on a failure,or double damage on a critical failure. The rules for basic saving throws are found on page 396.



## SPELL △TTACKS 

Some spells reguire you to succeed at a spell attack roll to affect the target. This is usually because they require you to
