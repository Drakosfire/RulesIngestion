## STARFINDER 

so long as they know the spell at that rank (see Heightened Spontaneous Spells below). When you heighten your spel.the spell's rank increases to match the higher rank of the spell slot you've prepared it in or used to cast it. This is useful for any spell, because some effects, such as counteracting,depend on the spell's rank.



In addition, many spells have additional specific benefits when they are heightened, such as increased damage. These extra benefits are described at the end of the spell's stat block.Some heightened entries specify one or more ranks at which the spell must be prepared or cast to gain these extra advantages. Each of these heightened entries states specifically which aspects of the spell change at the given rank. Read the heightened entry only for the spell rank you're using or preparing; if its benefits are meant to include any of the effects of a lower-rank heightened entry, those benefits will be included in the entry.



Other heightened entries give a number after a plus sign,indicating that heightening grants extra advantages over multiple ranks. The listed effect applies for every increment of ranks by which the spell is heightened above its lowest spell rank, and the benefit is cumulative, For example. slice reality says "Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d8."Because slice reality deals 7d8 void damage at 6th rank, a 7th-rank slice reglity would deal 8d8 yoid damage. an 8thrank spell would deal 9d8 void damage, and so on.

## Heightened Spontaneous Spells 

If you're a spontaneous spellcaster, you must know a spell at the specific rank that you want to cast it in order to heighten it. You can add a spell to your spell repertoire at more than a single rank so that you have more options when casting it For example, if you added skyfire wings to your repertoire as a 3rd-rank spell and again as a 7th-rank spell, you could cast it as a 3rd-rank or a 7th-rank spell; however, you couldn't cast it as a 5th-rank spell.



Many spontaneous spellcasting classes provide abilities like the signature spells class feature, which allows you to cast a limited number of spells as heightened versions even if you know the spell at only a single rank.



As a spontaneous caster, you can also choose to cast a lower-rank spell using a higher-rank spell slot without heightening it or knowing it at a higher rank. This casts the spell at the rank you know the spell, not the rank of the higher slot. The spell doesn't have any heightened effects.so it's usually not a yery efficient use of your magic outside of highly specific circumstances. For instance, if your party was having trouble with an invisible enemy, and you had revealing light in your repertoire but had already spent all of your 2nd-rank spell slots, it might be worth it to use a 3rd-rank spell slot to cast the spell, even though it'd have no heightened benefit.



## CANTRIPS 

A cantrip is a special type of spell that's weaker than other spells but can be used with greater freedom and flexibility.The title of a cantrip's stat block says "Cantrip" instead of "Spell", and the spell has the cantrip trait. Casting a cantrip doesn't use up your spell slots; you can cast a cantrip at will,any number of times per day. If you're a prepared caster, you can prepare a specific number of cantrips each day. You can't prepare a cantrip in a spell slot.



A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level, rounded up. For a typical spellcaster, this means its rank is equal to the highest rank of spell slot you have.

## FOCUS SPELLS 

Focus spells are a special type of spell attained directly from a specific source, such as a field of study, connection to a mystical force, or exposure to an alternate reality. You can learn focus spells only through special class features or feats,rather than choosing them from a spell list. Furthermore, you cast focus spells using a special pool of Focus Points-you can't prepare a focus spell in a spell slot or use your spell slots to cast focus spells; similarly,you can't spend your Focus Points to cast spells that aren't focus spells. Even some classes that don't normally grant spellcasting can grant focus spells. The title of a focus spell's stat block says "Focus" instead of "Spell",and the spell has the focus trait.



Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, just like cantrips are. You can't cast a focus spell if its minimum rank is greater than half your level rounded up, even if you somehow gain access to it.

Casting any of your focus spells costs you 1 Focus Point.You automatically gain a focus pool the first time you gain an ability that gives you a focus spell. The maximum number of points in your pool is equal to the number of focus spells you know or 3, whichever is lower. This counts only spells that require Focus Points to cast.



You replenish all the Focus Points in your pool during your daily preparations. You can also use the Refocus activity to pray, study, meditate, or otherwise reattune yourself to the source of your focus magic and regain 1 Focus Point. You can Refocus multiple times to regain multiple points, up to your pool's maximum.



## REFOCUS 

## CONCENTRATE EXPLORATION 

## Requirements You have a focus pool

You spend 10 minutes performing deeds to restore your magical connection. This restores 1 Focus Point to your focus pool. The deeds you need to perform are specified in the class or ability that gives you your focus spells. These deeds can usually overlap with other tasks that relate to the source of your focus spells. For instance. a witchwarper with focus points from their paradox can usually Refocus while using their paradox skill.
