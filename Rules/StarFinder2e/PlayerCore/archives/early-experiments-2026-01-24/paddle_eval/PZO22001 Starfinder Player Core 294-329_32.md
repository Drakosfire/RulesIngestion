## DISPELLING GLOBE 

## UNCOMMONCONCENTRATEMNIPULATE 

SPELL 4

Traditions arcane, divine, occult 

Area 10-foot burst centered on one corner of your space Duration 10 minutes 



You create an immobile globe around yourself. It attempts to counteract any spell from outside the globe whose area or targets enter into it, as if the globe were a dispel magic spell 1rank lower than its actual spell rank. If the counteract attempt succeeds, it prevents only the portion of the spell that would have entered the globe so if the spell also has targets outside the globe, or part of its area is beyond the globe, those targets or that area are affected normally). You must form the sphere in an unbroken open space, so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost (though creatures can enter the globe after the spell is cast).
