are determined by their connection, and a witchwarper's are determined by their paradox.



## NON-SPELLCAST RSWITH FOCUSSPELLS 

If you get focus spells from a class or other source that doesn't grant spellcasting ability, the ability that gives you focus spells also provides your proficiency for your spell attack modifier and spell DC, as well as the magical tradition of your focus spells. Though you can cast your focus spells,you don't qualify for feats and other rules that require you to be a spellcaster or have a spellcasting class feature-those require you to have spell slots.



## FOCUSPOINTSFROM MULTIPLE SOURCES  

It's possible, especially through archetypes, to gain focus spells from more than one source. If this happens, you have just one focus pool, counting all your focus spells to determine the points in your pool. You can spend any of your Focus Points on any of your focus spells. Likewise, when you Refocus, you get back a point as long as you follow the guidelines of any abilities that granted you focus spells.Having Focus Points from multiple sources doesn't change the tradition of your spells; if you had both healing epiphany spells and precog warp spells, your mystic spells would remain divine and the witchwarper spells occult. Similarly,you need to use the attribute modifier determined by the source of the focus spell.



## I NNATE SPELLS 

Certain spells are natural to your character,typically coming from your ancestry or a magic item. They're called innate spells. Innate spells don't let you qualify for abilities that require you to be a spellcaster-those require you to have spell slots. The ability that gives you an innate spell tells you how often you can cast it-usually once per day-and its magical tradition. Innate spells are refreshed during your daily preparations. Innate cantrips are cast at will and automatically heightened as normal for cantrips (page 298]unless otherwise specified.



When you gain an innate spell, you become trained in the spell attack modifier and spell DC statistics. At 12th level, these proficiencies increase to expert. Unless noted otherwise, Charisma is your spellcasting attribute modifier for innate spells.



If you have an innate spell, you can cast it even if it's not of a spell rank you can normally cast.This is especially common for monsters.
