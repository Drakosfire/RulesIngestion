## STARFINDER 

You can't use your spell slots to cast your innate spells, but you might have an innate spell and also be able to prepare or cast the same spell through your class. You also can't heighten innate spells, but some abilities that grant innate spells might give you the spell at a higher rank than its base rank or change the rank at which you cast the spell.

## CASTING SPELLS 

The casting of a spell can range from a simple word of magical might that creates a fleeting effect to a complex process taking hours to cast and producing a long-term impact Casting a spell reguires the caster to make gestures and utter incantations, so being unable to speak prevents spellcasting for most casters. If your character has a long-term disability that prevents or complicates them from speaking as described in GM Core), work with the GM to determine an analogous way they cast their spells, such as tapping in code on their comm unit or whistling.



Spellcasting creates obvious sensory manifestations, such as bright lights, crackling sounds, and sharp smells from the gathering magic.Nearly all spells manifest a spell signaturea colorful, glowing ring of magical runes or circuitry that appears in midair, typically around your hands, though what kind of spellcaster you are can affect this-witchwarpers'signatures often look like ripples or winkles in reality,and a mystic's might be inspired by their connection. How spellcasting looks can vary from one spellcasting tradition or class to another, or even from person to person. You have a great deal of freedom in flavoring your character's magic however you wish!



Spells can vary in how many actions they take, as shown in the spell's stat block. You cast cantrips, spells from spell slots,and focus spells using the same process, but must expend the spell when casting a spell from a spell slot and must spend 1Focus Point to cast a focus spell. Some rules will refer to the Cast a Spell activity, such as "if the next action you use is to Cast a Spell." Any spell qualifies as a Cast a Spell activity, and any characteristics of the spell use those of the specific spel you're casting.



## COSTS AND LOCI 

Some spells require you to pay a cost or provide a locus.If the spell lists a cost, you must have the listed money, valuable materials, or other resources to cast the spell (such as gems or magical reagents), and they're expended during the casting.

A locus is an object that funnels or directs the magical energy of the spell but is not consumed in its casting. As part of Casting the Spell, you retrieve the locus if necessary, and if you have a free hand, and you can put it away again if you so choose. Loci tend to be expensive, and you need to acquire them in advance to cast the spell, but they aren't expended like costs are. Unless noted otherwise, a locus has negligible Bulk.

## LONGCASTINGTIMES 

Some spells take minutes or hours to cast. You can't use other actions or reactions while casting such a spell.though at the GM's discretion, you might be able to speak a few sentences.As with other activities that take a long time, these spells have the exploration trait, and you can't cast them in an encounter. If combat breaks out while you're casting one, your spell is disrupted (see Disrupted and Lost Spells below).



## DISRUPTEDANDLOSTSPELLS 

Some abilities and spells can disrupt a spell, causing it to have no effect and be lost. When you lose a spell, you've already expended the spell slot and spent the spell's costs and actions.Ifa spell is disrupted during a Sustain action,the spell immediately ends. The full rules for disrupting actions appear on page 407.



## R△NGES, △RE△S, △ND TARGETS  

Spells with a range can affect targets, create areas, or make things appear only within that range. Most spell ranges are measured in feet, though some can stretch oyer miles. reach anywhere on the planet, or go even farther!

## TOUCH RANGE 

A spell with a touch range requires you to physically touch the target. You use your unarmed reach to determine whether you can touch the creature. You can usually touch them automatically, though the spell might specify that they can attempt a saving throw or that you must attempt a spell attack roll. If an ability increases the range of a touch spell start at O feet and increase from there.



## AREAS 

Sometimes a spell has an area, which can be a burst, cone,emanation, or line [pages 420-421]. If the spell originates from your position, the spell has only an area; if you can cause the spell's area to appear farther away from you, the spell has both a range and an area.



## TARGETS 

Some spells allow you to target a creature, an object, or something more specific. The target must be within the spell's range, and you must be able to see it or otherwise perceive it with a precise sense to target it. At the GM's discretion, you can attempt to target a creature you can't see, as described in Detecting Creatures on page 425. If you fail to target a particular creature,this doesn't change how the spell affects any other targets the spell has.

If you choose a target that isn't valid, such as if you thought a driftdead was a living creature and targeted it with a spell that can target only living creatures,your spel fails to target that creature. If a creature starts out as a valid target but ceases to be one during a spell's duration,the spell typically ends,but the GMmight decide otherwise in certain situations. Some spells restrict you to willing targets.A player can declare their character a willing or unwilling target at any time, regardless of turn order or
