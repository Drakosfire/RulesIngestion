STARFINDER

## CHAPTER 7: SPELLS

Whether it comes in the form of eldritch artifacts, otherworldly beings, or witchwarpers altering reality with strange spells, magic brings fantasy and wonder to Starfinder. This chapter explains how spells work and how spellcasters prepare and cast their spells.

<!-- image -->

Even with the widespread presence of technology, spellcasters  can  be  found  in  every  corner  of  the  galaxy. Some spellcasters draw magic from other realities, some from  their  mystical  connections  to  cosmic  forces,  and others rewrite the underlying code of the universe to cast their spells.

With special gestures and utterances, a spellcaster can call forth mystic energies, warp the mind, protect themself against  danger,  or  even  create  something  from  nothing. Each  class  has  its  own  method  of  learning,  preparing, and casting spells, and every individual spell produces a specific effect, so learning new spells gives a spellcaster an increasing array of options to accomplish their goals.

## SPELL SLOTS

Characters of spellcasting classes can cast a number of spells each day; the spells you can cast in a day are referred to as spell slots. At 1st level, a character has only a small number of 1st-rank spell slots per day, but as you advance in level, you gain more spell slots of higher rank. A spell's rank indicates its overall power, from 1 to 10.

## PREPARED SPELLS

If  you're  a  prepared  spellcaster-such  as  a  technomancer (see Starfinder Tech Core )-you must spend time each day preparing  spells  for  that  day.  At  the  start  of  your  daily preparations,  you  select  a  number  of  spells  of  different spell ranks, determined by your character level and class. Your spells remain prepared until you cast them or until you prepare spells again.

Each  prepared  spell  is  expended  after  a  single  casting, so if you want to cast a particular spell more than once in a  day,  you  need  to  prepare  that  spell  multiple  times.  The exception to this rule is for spells with the cantrip trait; once you prepare a cantrip, you can cast it as many times as you want until the next time you prepare spells. See page 296 for more information on cantrips.

You  might  gain  an  ability  that  allows  you  to  swap prepared spells or perform other aspects of preparing spells at different times throughout the day, but only your daily preparation counts for the purpose of effects that last until the next time you prepare spells.

## SPELLCASTING IN STARFINDER

After  Triune's  Signal  connected  cultures  across  the Universe, the peoples of the galaxy have learned more than  ever  before  about  the  Universe's  composition thanks  to  science  and  technology.  As  technology improves  and  creates  mass-market  marvels  rivaling what was once only possible for a powerful spellcaster, magic is more static, with arcane universities, occult societies, and religious orders preserving ancient techniques and tomes into the modern era.  Many  specialty  tech  items  incorporate  hybrid magitechnology, and most spellcasters carry a backup gun  or  other  tech  gear  on  them  for  when  they  run out of spells. Magic and technology coexist, but most spellcasters use analog spellcasting, and blending the two together to create a hybrid item requires training. Only a few spellcasters mix magic with technologythey're seen as mavericks by most established magical institutions. Technomancers  and  spellcasters  who have learned to command machines or connect with computers using magic blaze a trail few have explored.

## SPONTANEOUS SPELLS

If  you're  a  spontaneous  spellcaster-such  as  a  mystic-you choose  which  spell  from  your  spell  repertoire  that  you're using a spell slot for at the moment you decide to cast it. This provides you with more freedom in your spellcasting, but you have fewer spells in your spell repertoire, as determined by your character level and class. When you make your daily preparations, all your spell slots are refreshed, but you don't get to change the spells in your repertoire.

## HEIGHTENED SPELLS

Both prepared and spontaneous spellcasters can cast a spell at  a  higher  spell  rank  than  that  listed  for  the  spell.  This  is called  heightening  the  spell.  A  prepared  spellcaster  can heighten  a  spell  by  preparing  it  in  a  higher-rank  slot  than its  normal  spell  rank,  while  a  spontaneous  spellcaster  can heighten a spell by casting it using a higher-rank spell slot,

## STARFINDER

so long as they know the spell at that rank (see Heightened Spontaneous Spells below). When you heighten your spell, the  spell's  rank  increases  to  match  the  higher  rank  of  the spell slot you've prepared it in or used to cast it. This is useful for any spell, because some effects, such as counteracting, depend on the spell's rank.

In addition, many spells have additional specific benefits when they are heightened, such as increased damage. These extra  benefits  are  described  at  the  end  of  the  spell's  stat block.  Some  heightened  entries  specify  one  or  more  ranks at  which  the  spell  must  be  prepared  or  cast  to  gain  these extra  advantages.  Each  of  these  heightened  entries  states specifically  which  aspects  of  the  spell  change  at  the  given rank. Read the heightened entry only for the spell rank you're using or preparing; if its benefits are meant to include any of the effects of a lower-rank heightened entry, those benefits will be included in the entry.

Other heightened entries give a number after a plus sign, indicating  that  heightening  grants  extra  advantages  over multiple ranks. The listed effect applies for every increment of ranks by which the spell is heightened above its lowest spell rank, and the benefit is cumulative. For example, slice reality says ' Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d8.' Because slice reality deals  7d8  void  damage  at  6th  rank,  a 7th-rank slice reality would deal 8d8 void damage, an 8thrank spell would deal 9d8 void damage, and so on.

## Heightened Spontaneous Spells

If you're a spontaneous spellcaster, you must know a spell at the specific rank that you want to cast it in order to heighten it. You can add a spell to your spell repertoire at more than a single rank so that you have more options when casting it. For example, if you added skyfire wings to your repertoire as a 3rd-rank spell and again as a 7th-rank spell, you could cast it as a 3rd-rank or a 7th-rank spell; however, you couldn't cast it as a 5th-rank spell.

Many  spontaneous  spellcasting  classes  provide  abilities like  the  signature spells class feature, which allows you to cast a limited number of spells as heightened versions even if you know the spell at only a single rank.

As  a  spontaneous  caster,  you  can  also  choose  to  cast a  lower-rank  spell  using  a  higher-rank  spell  slot  without heightening it or knowing it at a higher rank. This casts the spell  at  the  rank  you  know  the  spell,  not  the  rank  of  the higher  slot.  The  spell  doesn't  have  any  heightened  effects, so it's usually not a very efficient use of your magic outside of highly specific circumstances. For instance, if your party was  having  trouble  with  an  invisible  enemy,  and  you  had revealing light in  your  repertoire  but  had  already  spent  all of  your  2nd-rank  spell  slots,  it  might  be  worth  it  to  use  a 3rd-rank spell slot to cast the spell, even though it'd have no heightened benefit.

## CANTRIPS

A cantrip is a special type of spell that's weaker than other spells but can be used with greater freedom and flexibility.

The  title  of  a  cantrip's  stat  block  says  'Cantrip'  instead  of 'Spell', and the spell has the cantrip trait. Casting a cantrip doesn't use up your spell slots; you can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. If you're a prepared caster, you can prepare a specific number of cantrips each day. You can't prepare a cantrip in a spell slot.

A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level,  rounded  up.  For  a  typical  spellcaster,  this  means  its rank is equal to the highest rank of spell slot you have.

## FOCUS SPELLS

Focus spells are a special type of spell attained directly from a  specific  source,  such  as  a  field  of  study,  connection  to  a mystical  force,  or  exposure  to  an  alternate  reality.  You  can learn focus spells only through special class features or feats, rather than choosing them from a spell list. Furthermore, you cast focus spells using a special pool of Focus Points-you can't prepare a focus spell in a spell slot or use your spell slots to cast focus spells; similarly, you can't spend your Focus Points to cast spells that aren't focus spells. Even some classes that don't normally grant spellcasting can grant focus spells. The title of a focus spell's stat block says 'Focus' instead of 'Spell', and the spell has the focus trait.

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, just like cantrips are. You can't cast a focus spell if  its  minimum rank is greater than half your level rounded up, even if you somehow gain access to it.

Casting any of your focus spells costs you 1 Focus Point. You automatically gain a focus pool the first time you gain an ability that gives you a focus spell. The maximum number of points in your pool is equal to the number of focus spells you know or 3, whichever is lower. This counts only spells that require Focus Points to cast.

You replenish all the Focus Points in your pool during your daily preparations. You can also use the Refocus activity to pray, study, meditate, or otherwise reattune yourself to the source of your focus magic and regain 1 Focus Point. You can Refocus multiple times to regain multiple points, up to your pool's maximum.

## REFOCUS

## CONCENTRATE EXPLORATION

## Requirements You have a focus pool.

You  spend  10  minutes  performing  deeds  to  restore  your magical connection. This restores 1 Focus Point to your focus pool. The deeds you need to perform are specified in the class or ability that gives you your focus spells. These deeds can usually  overlap  with  other  tasks  that  relate  to  the  source of your focus spells. For instance, a witchwarper with focus points  from  their  paradox  can  usually  Refocus  while  using their paradox skill.

## SPELLCASTERS WITH FOCUS SPELLS

If you are a spellcaster, your focus spells are the same tradition of spell as the class that gave you the focus spell. A mystic's

## MAGICAL TRADITIONS

Spellcasters cast spells from one of four different spell lists, each representing a different magical tradition: arcane, divine, occult, and primal.

Your class determines which tradition of magic your spells use. In some cases, such as when a mystic gains spells from their connection or when a witchwarper learns spells from their paradox, you might be able to cast one or more select spells from a different spell list than the list you normally cast from; for instance, mystics with the elemental connection can conjure a spiritual guardian , perhaps in the form of a nature deity's attendant or servitor. In these cases, the spell uses your magic tradition, not the list the spell normally comes from. When you cast a spell, add your tradition's trait to the spell.

Some types of magic, such as that of most magic items, don't belong to any single tradition. These have the magical trait instead of a tradition trait.

<!-- image -->

## Arcane

Arcane spellcasters use logic and rationality to categorize the magic inherent in the world around them. Because of its far-reaching approach, the arcane tradition  has  the  broadest  spell list, though it's generally poor at affecting the spirit or the  soul.  Witchwarpers  who  analyze  probability  and spellcasters who draw magic from the underlying code of the Universe are practitioners of arcane magic.

<!-- image -->

## Divine

The power of the divine is steeped in faith, the unseen, and belief in a power source from beyond the Universe. Mystics connected with the cosmic forces of healing and shadows are divine spellcasters.

are determined by their connection, and a witchwarper's are determined by their paradox.

## NON-SPELLCASTERS WITH FOCUS SPELLS

If  you  get  focus  spells  from  a  class  or  other  source  that doesn't grant spellcasting ability, the ability that gives you focus  spells  also  provides  your  proficiency  for  your  spell attack modifier and spell DC, as well as the magical tradition of your focus spells. Though you can cast your focus spells, you don't qualify for feats and other rules that require you to be a spellcaster or have a spellcasting class feature-those require you to have spell slots.

## FOCUS POINTS FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES

It's  possible,  especially  through  archetypes,  to  gain  focus spells  from  more  than  one  source.  If  this  happens,  you have  just  one  focus  pool,  counting  all  your  focus  spells  to determine the points in your pool. You can spend any of your Focus  Points  on  any  of  your  focus  spells.  Likewise,  when you Refocus, you get back a point as long as you follow the guidelines  of  any  abilities  that  granted  you  focus  spells. Having  Focus  Points  from  multiple  sources  doesn't  change the tradition of your spells; if you had both healing epiphany

<!-- image -->

## Occult

The  practitioners  of  occult  traditions  seek to  understand the unexplainable, categorize the  bizarre,  and  otherwise  access  the  ephemeral  in  a systematic  way.  Witchwarpers  touched  by  the  Gap  or alternate timelines, as well as mystics who are psychically linked to the Akashic Record, are occult spellcasters.

<!-- image -->

## Primal

An instinctual connection to and faith in the world, the cycle of day and night, the turning of the seasons, and the natural selection of predator and prey  drive  the  primal  tradition.  Mystics  connected  to the  primordial  elements  and  underlying  rhythms  of  the cosmos are primal spellcasters. wy spells  and  precog  warp  spells,  your  mystic  spells  would remain  divine  and  the  witchwarper  spells  occult.  Similarly, you  need  to  use  the  attribute  modifier  determined  by  the source of the focus spell.

## INNATE SPELLS

Certain spells are natural to your character, typically coming from  your  ancestry  or  a  magic  item.  They're  called  innate spells.  Innate  spells  don't  let  you  qualify  for  abilities  that require  you  to  be  a  spellcaster-those  require  you  to  have spell  slots.  The  ability  that  gives  you  an  innate  spell  tells you  how  often  you  can  cast  it-usually  once  per  day-and its  magical  tradition.  Innate  spells  are  refreshed  during your daily preparations. Innate cantrips are cast at will and automatically heightened as normal for cantrips (page 298) unless otherwise specified.

When  you  gain  an  innate  spell,  you  become  trained  in the  spell  attack  modifier  and  spell  DC  statistics.  At  12th level,  these  proficiencies  increase  to  expert.  Unless  noted otherwise,  Charisma  is  your  spellcasting  attribute  modifier for innate spells.

If you have an innate spell, you can cast it even if it's not of a spell rank you can normally cast. This is especially common for monsters.

## STARFINDER

You can't use your spell slots to cast your innate spells, but you might have an innate spell and also be able to prepare or  cast  the  same  spell  through  your  class.  You  also  can't heighten innate spells, but some abilities that grant innate spells might give you the spell at a higher rank than its base rank or change the rank at which you cast the spell.

## CASTING SPELLS

The casting of a spell can range from a simple word of magical might  that  creates  a  fleeting  effect  to  a  complex  process taking  hours  to  cast  and  producing  a  long-term  impact. Casting a spell requires the caster to make gestures and utter incantations, so being unable to speak prevents spellcasting for most casters. If your character has a long-term disability that prevents or complicates them from speaking (as described in GM Core ),  work  with  the  GM  to  determine  an analogous way they cast their spells, such as tapping in code on their comm unit or whistling.

Spellcasting creates obvious sensory manifestations, such as bright lights, crackling sounds, and sharp smells from the gathering magic. Nearly all spells manifest a spell signature-a colorful,  glowing  ring  of  magical  runes  or  circuitry  that appears in midair, typically around your hands, though what kind  of  spellcaster  you  are  can  affect  this-witchwarpers' signatures  often  look  like  ripples  or  winkles  in  reality, and a mystic's might be inspired by their connection. How spellcasting looks can vary from one spellcasting tradition or class  to  another,  or  even  from  person  to  person.  You  have a great deal of freedom in flavoring your character's magic however you wish!

Spells can vary in how many actions they take, as shown in the spell's stat block. You cast cantrips, spells from spell slots, and focus spells using the same process, but must expend the spell when casting a spell from a spell slot and must spend 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. Some rules will refer to the Cast a Spell activity, such as 'if the next action you use is to Cast a Spell.' Any spell qualifies as a Cast a Spell activity, and any characteristics of the spell use those of the specific spell you're casting.

## COSTS AND LOCI

Some spells require you to pay a cost or provide a locus. If the spell lists a cost ,  you must have the listed money, valuable materials, or other resources to cast the spell (such as gems or magical reagents), and they're expended during the casting.

A locus is  an  object  that  funnels  or  directs  the  magical energy of the spell but is not consumed in its casting. As part of Casting the Spell, you retrieve the locus (if necessary, and if you have a free hand), and you can put it away again if you so choose. Loci tend to be expensive, and you need to acquire them in advance to cast the spell, but they aren't expended like costs are. Unless noted otherwise, a locus has negligible Bulk.

## LONG CASTING TIMES

Some spells take minutes or hours to cast. You can't use other  actions  or  reactions  while  casting  such  a  spell, though at the GM's discretion, you might be able to speak a few sentences. As with other activities that take a long time, these spells have the exploration trait, and you can't cast  them  in  an  encounter.  If  combat  breaks  out  while you're casting one, your spell is disrupted (see Disrupted and Lost Spells below).

## DISRUPTED AND LOST SPELLS

Some  abilities  and  spells  can  disrupt  a  spell,  causing  it  to have  no  effect  and  be  lost.  When  you  lose  a  spell,  you've already expended the spell slot and spent the spell's costs and actions. If a spell is disrupted during a Sustain action, the spell immediately ends. The full rules for disrupting actions appear on page 407.

## RANGES, AREAS, AND TARGETS

Spells with a range can affect targets, create areas, or make things appear only within that range. Most spell ranges are measured in feet, though some can stretch over miles, reach anywhere on the planet, or go even farther!

## TOUCH RANGE

A spell with a touch range requires you to physically touch the  target.  You  use  your  unarmed  reach  to  determine whether you can touch the creature. You can usually touch them automatically, though the spell might specify that they can attempt a saving throw or that you must attempt a spell attack roll. If an ability increases the range of a touch spell, start at 0 feet and increase from there.

## AREAS

Sometimes a spell has an area, which can be a burst, cone, emanation,  or  line  (pages  420-421).  If  the  spell  originates from  your  position,  the  spell  has  only  an  area;  if  you  can cause the spell's area to appear farther away from you, the spell has both a range and an area.

## TARGETS

Some spells allow you to target a creature, an object, or something  more  specific.  The  target  must  be  within  the spell's range, and you must be able to see it (or otherwise perceive it with a precise sense) to target it. At the GM's discretion, you can attempt to target a creature you can't see,  as  described in Detecting Creatures on page 425. If you fail to target a particular creature, this doesn't change how the spell affects any other targets the spell has.

If  you  choose  a  target  that  isn't  valid,  such  as  if  you thought a driftdead was a living creature and targeted it with a spell that can target only living creatures, your spell fails  to  target that creature. If a creature starts out as a valid target but ceases to be one during a spell's duration, the spell typically ends, but the GM might decide otherwise in  certain  situations.  Some  spells  restrict  you  to  willing targets. A player can declare their character a willing or unwilling target at any time, regardless of turn order or

## OTHER SPELL TRAITS

Below is a glossary of a few traits you might see with important rules.

## Darkness and Light

Non-magical light always shines in non-magical darkness and always fails to shine in magical darkness. Magical light always shines in non-magical darkness but shines in magical darkness only if the light spell has a higher rank than that of the darkness effect. Spells with the darkness trait or the light trait can always counteract one another, but bringing light  and  darkness  into  contact  doesn't  automatically  do so. You must usually cast a light spell on a darkness effect directly to counteract it (and vice versa), but some spells automatically attempt to counteract opposing effects.

## Minion

Minions are creatures that directly serve another creature. Your minion acts on your turn in combat, once per turn, when you spend an action to issue it commands. For a companion, you Command it; for a minion that's a spell or magic item effect, like a summoned minion, you Sustain the effect (page 411); if not otherwise specified, you issue a verbal command as a single action with the auditory and concentrate traits. If given no commands, minions use no actions except to defend themselves or to escape obvious harm. If left unattended for long  enough,  typically  1  minute,  mindless  minions  usually don't act, animals follow their instincts, and sapient minions act  how  they  please.  You  can  have  a  maximum  of  four minions under your control.

A  minion  has  only  2  actions  and  0  reactions  per  turn, though  certain  conditions  (such  as  slowed  or  quickened) or abilities might give them additional actions or a reaction. Alterations to a minion's actions occur when they gain their actions for the round. A minion can't control other creatures.

## Summoned

A creature called by a spell or effect gains the summoned trait. A summoned creature can't summon other creatures, create things of value, or cast spells that require a cost. It has the minion trait. If it tries to cast a spell of equal or higher rank than the spell that summoned it, it overpowers the summoning magic, causing its own spell to fail and the summon spell to end. Otherwise, the summoned creature uses  the  standard  abilities  for  a  creature  of  its  kind.  It generally attacks your enemies to the best of its ability. If you can communicate with it, you can attempt to command it,  but the GM determines the degree to which it follows your commands.

Immediately when you finish casting, the summoned creature uses its 2 actions for that turn. A spawn or other creature generated from a summoned creature returns to its unaltered state once the summoned creature is gone. If it's unclear what this state would be, the GM decides. Summoned creatures can be banished by various spells and effects. They are automatically banished if reduced to 0 Hit Points or if the spell that called them ends.

## Morph

Spells that slightly alter a creature's form have the morph trait. Any Strikes specifically granted by a magical morph effect also gain the magical trait. You can be affected by multiple morph spells  at  once,  but  if  you  morph  the  same  body  part  more than  once,  the  second  morph  effect  attempts  to  counteract the  first  (in  the  same  manner  as  two  polymorph  effects, described below). Your morph effects might also end if you are polymorphed and the polymorph effect invalidates or overrides your morph effect. For instance, a morph that gave you wings would be dismissed if you polymorphed into a form that had wings of its own (though if your new form lacked wings, you'd keep the wings from your morph). The GM determines which morph effects can be used together and which can't.

## Polymorph

These effects completely transform the target into a new form.  A  target  can't  be  under  the  effect  of  more  than one polymorph at a time. If it comes under the effect of another, the second effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target. Any Strikes granted by a polymorph effect  are  magical.  Unless  otherwise  stated,  polymorph spells  don't  allow  the  target  to  take  on  the  appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a generic creature of a general type or ancestry.

If you take on a battle form with a polymorph spell, the special  statistics  can  be  adjusted  only  by  circumstance bonuses,  status  bonuses,  and  penalties.  Unless  otherwise noted,  the  battle  form  prevents  you  from  casting  spells, speaking,  and  using  most  manipulate  actions  that  require hands. (If there's doubt about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function, but you can't activate any items. If a polymorph effect causes you to increase in size, you must have space to expand into or the effect is disrupted.

## Illusions

Magic  with  the  illusion  trait  creates  false  sensory  stimuli. Sometimes illusions  allow  creatures  a  chance  to  disbelieve the spell, which lets the creature ignore the spell if it succeeds at  doing  so.  This  usually  happens  when  a  creature  Seeks, Interacts,  or  otherwise  spends  actions  to  engage  with  the illusion,  comparing  the  result  of  its  Perception  check  (or another check or save the GM chooses) to the caster's spell DC.  Mental  illusions  typically  provide  rules  in  the  spell's description for disbelieving the effect (usually via a Will save).

If a creature engages with an illusion in a way that would prove it's not what it seems, the creature might know that an illusion is present, but it still can't ignore the illusion without successfully disbelieving it. Disbelieving a visual illusion makes it and those things it blocks seem hazy and indistinct, which might block vision enough to leave the other side concealed.

STARFINDER

## SUBTLE SPELLS

A spell with the subtle trait can be cast without incantations and  doesn't have obvious manifestations. Most of these spells enhance your subterfuge  or  stealth,  such  as invisibility .  Some abilities, like the Conceal Spell feat (page 122), allow you  to  make  spells  subtle  even  if  they  wouldn't normally be.

## SPELLSHAPE

Many  spellcasters  can  gain  access  to  spellshape actions, typically by  selecting spellshape  feats. Spellshape  actions  tweak  the  properties  of  your spells.  You  must  use  a  spellshape  action  directly before  casting  the  spell  you  want  to  alter.  If  you use any action (including free actions and reactions) other than casting a spell directly after, you waste the benefits of the spellshape action. The benefit is also lost if your turn ends before you cast the spell. Any additional effects added by a spellshape action are part of the spell's effect, not of the spellshape action itself.

their  character's  condition  (such  as  when  a  character  is paralyzed, unconscious, or even dead).

Spells  that  affect  multiple  creatures  in  an  area  can  have both an Area entry and a Targets entry. A spell that has an area but no targets listed usually affects all creatures in the area indiscriminately.

## LINE OF EFFECT

You  usually  need  an  unobstructed  path  to  the  target  of a spell, the origin point of an area, or the place where you create  something with a spell. More information on line of effect can be found on page 418.

## DURATIONS

The duration of a spell is how long the spell effect lasts. Spells that last for more than an instant have a Duration entry. A spell  might  last  until  the  start  or  end  of  a  turn,  for  some number of  rounds,  for  minutes,  or  even  longer.  If  a  spell's duration is given in rounds, the number of rounds remaining decreases by 1 at the start of each of the spellcaster's turns, ending when the duration reaches 0.

Some spells have effects that remain even after the spell's magic is gone. Any ongoing effect that isn't part of the spell's duration  entry  isn't  magical.  For  instance,  a  spell  such  as sunburst that  creates a brief, intensely bright flash of light might  blind  someone  for  a  time,  even  permanently.  This blindness  couldn't  be  counteracted  because  it  is  not  itself magical (though it might be cured by other magic, such as sound body ).

If a spell's caster dies or is incapacitated during the spell's duration, the spell remains in effect until its duration ends, using the caster's initiative order.

## SUSTAINING SPELLS

If the spell's duration is 'sustained,' it lasts until the end of your next turn unless you use the Sustain action (page 411) on that turn to extend the duration of that spell.

## LONG DURATIONS

If  a  spell's  duration  says  it  lasts  until  your  next  daily preparations, on the next day you can refrain from preparing a new spell in that spell's slot. (If you are a spontaneous caster, you can instead expend a spell slot during your preparations.) Doing so extends the spell's  duration  until  your  next  daily preparations. This effectively Sustains the spell over a long period of time. If you prepare a new spell in the slot (or don't expend a spell slot), the spell ends. You can't do this if the spell didn't come from one of your spell slots. If you are dead or otherwise incapacitated at the 24-hour mark after the time you Cast the Spell or the last time you extended its duration, the  spell  ends.  Spells  with  an  unlimited  duration  last  until counteracted or Dismissed. You don't need to keep a spell slot open for these spells.

## DISMISSING

Some  spells  can  be  dismissed,  ending  the  duration  early. This requires the caster or target to use the Dismiss action (page 411).

## DEFENSES

If a spell allows the target to attempt a saving throw or use their AC to defend against it, the type of defense is listed in the stat block. Any details on the particular results and timing of the save appear in the text unless the entry specifies a basic saving throw, which follows a standard rule. If a spell allows a  defense only under certain circumstances or at a certain time, the Defenses entry is omitted, since the text needs to explain it in more detail. Whenever a spell allows a saving throw, it uses the caster's spell DC, and one that allows AC as a defense typically requires a spell attack. More information on how to calculate your spell DC and spell attack modifier appears starting on page 394.

## BASIC SAVING THROWS

If a spell's Defenses entry specifies a 'basic' saving throw, the spell's potential effects all relate to the damage listed in the spell's description. The target takes no damage on a critical success, half damage on a success, full damage on a failure, or  double  damage  on  a  critical  failure.  The  rules  for  basic saving throws are found on page 396.

## SPELL ATTACKS

Some spells require you to succeed at a spell attack roll to affect the target. This is usually because they require you to

precisely aim a ray or otherwise make an accurate attack. A spell attack roll is compared to the target's AC. Spell attack rolls  benefit  from  any  bonuses  or  penalties  to  attack  rolls, including  your  multiple  attack  penalty,  but  not  any  special benefits or penalties that apply only to weapon or unarmed attacks. Spell attacks don't deal any damage beyond what's listed in the spell description.

In  rare  cases,  a  spell  might  have  you  make  some  other type of attack, such as a weapon Strike. Such attacks use the normal rules and attack bonus for that type of attack.

## IDENTIFYING SPELLS

Sometimes  you  need  to  identify  a  spell,  especially  if  its effects  aren't  obvious  right  away.  If  you  notice  a  spell being  cast,  and  you  have  that  spell  in  your  repertoire or prepared it that day (even if you already cast it), you automatically know what the spell is, including the rank to which it is heightened.

If you want to identify a spell but don't have it prepared or  in  your  repertoire,  you  must  spend  an  action  on  your turn attempting to identify it using Recall Knowledge. You typically notice a spell being cast due to its sensory spell manifestations (page 298). Identifying long-lasting spells that  are  already  in  place  requires  using  Identify  Magic instead of Recall Knowledge because you don't have the advantage of watching the spell being cast.

## COUNTERACTING

Some spells, such as dispel magic ,  can be used to eliminate the effects of other spells. At least one creature, object, or manifestation of the spell you are trying to counteract must be within range of the spell that you are using. You attempt a counteract check (page 423) using your Charisma (or other spellcasting  attribute  modifier)  and  your  proficiency  bonus for spell attack rolls.

## HOSTILE ACTIONS

Sometimes  spells  prevent  a  target  from  using  hostile actions,  or  the  spell  ends  if  a  creature  uses  any  hostile actions.  A  hostile  action  is  one  that  can  harm  or  damage another creature, whether directly or indirectly, but not one that a creature is unaware could cause harm. For instance, casting sonic scream into a crowd would be a hostile action, but  opening  a  door  and  accidentally  freeing  a  horrible monster wouldn't be. The GM is the final arbitrator of what is a hostile action.

## SETTING TRIGGERS

If  a  spell  is  meant to respond only to certain events or under certain  conditions,  it  might  require  you  to  set  a  trigger.  This is  a  simple  sensory  cue  that  causes the spell to activate. The spell  activates  as  a  reaction  when the spell's sensor observes something that fits its trigger. Depending on the spell, the trigger

## PLAYER CORE

might be the presence of a type of creature, such as 'creatures with six or more tentacles,' or it could be an observed action, such as 'whenever someone enters the spell's area.'

Disguises  and  illusions  fool  the  spell  as  long  as  they appear  to  match  its  parameters.  For  a  spell  to  detect something visually, the spell's origin point must have line of sight. Darkness doesn't prevent this, but invisibility does, as does a successful Stealth check to Hide (against the spell's DC).  For  auditory  detection,  line  of  sight  isn't  necessary, though the sound must be audible at the spell's origin point. A Stealth check to Sneak can fool the sensor.

## WALLS

Spells  that  create  walls,  such  as wall  of  plasma ,  list  the depth, length, and height of the wall, also specifying how it  can  be  positioned. Some walls can be shaped; you can manipulate the wall into a form other than a straight line, choosing its contiguous path square by square. The path of  a  shaped  wall  can't  enter  the  same  space  more  than once, but it can double back so one section is adjacent to another section of the wall.

## READING SPELLS

Each spell uses the following format. Entries appear only when  applicable,  so  not  all  spells  will  have  every  entry described  here.  The  spell's  name  line  also  lists  the  type of spell if it's a cantrip or focus spell, as well as the rank.

## SPELL NAME [one-action]

## TRAITS

- Tradition This  entry  lists  the  magical  traditions  the  spell belongs  to.  Some  feats  or  other  abilities  might  add  a spell to your spell list even if you don't follow the listed traditions.
- Cast Spells that take longer than a single turn to cast include this entry to list the time required, such as '1 minute.' If the spell has a cost, locus, requirements, or a trigger, that information is also listed in this section.
- Range, Area, and Targets This  entry lists the range of the spell, the area it affects, and the targets it can affect, if any. If none of these entries are present, the spell affects only the caster.
- Defense and Duration If a spell allows the target to attempt a saving throw or use their AC to defend against it, the type of defense appears here (see page 300 for details). A Duration entry appears if the spell has one. A spell that doesn't  list  a  duration  takes  place  instantaneously,  and anything created by it persists after the spell.

A  horizontal  line  follows  defense  and  duration,  and  the effects of the spell are described after this line. This section might  also  detail  the  possible  results  of  a  saving  throw: critical success, success, failure, and critical failure.

Heightened (rank)  If  the  spell  has  special  effects  when heightened (page 295), those effects appear at the end of the stat block.

Range touch; Targets 1 held or unattended object or a 5-foot- square surface

Duration

1 minute

You create a molecular bond between an unattended object you touch (or an object you're holding) and another object or surface that object is touching. Pulling the object free of that surface  requires  a  successful  Athletics  check  against  your spell DC to Force Open.

If  you  instead  touch  one  unoccupied  5-foot  square,  that surface  becomes  charged  with  adhering  magic.  That  space becomes greater difficult terrain.

## AERIAL FORM [two-actions]

You harness your mastery of the sky to reshape your body into a Medium flying animal battle form. When you Cast this Spell, choose a listed battle form.

If your attack modifier for Dexterity-based unarmed attacks is higher, you can use it instead.
- Acrobatics modifier of +16, unless your own is higher.

## AKASHIC DOWNLOAD [three-actions]

## CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE

Traditions occult

Requirements You  have a comm unit or computer, used as a locus.

## Duration 1 day

You  execute  a  psychic  search  of  the  Akashic  Record  for information about a specific topic and magically transfer this data  to  your  comm  unit  or  computer.  When  you  Cast  this Spell, choose any skill in which you're trained that has the Recall Knowledge action.

Any time during the duration, you can consult your comm unit while attempting a Recall Knowledge check using your chosen skill.  This  check  gains  a  +1  status  bonus.  Checking your comm unit is part of the action to Recall Knowledge. You must be holding the comm unit to do so. The comm unit instantly compiles and displays snippets and selections from various  media  relevant  to  the  topic,  which  grants  you  the bonus. If you roll a critical failure on this check, you get a failure instead. If the check is successful and the subject is a creature, you gain additional information or context about the  creature.  Once  you  reference  the  comm  unit,  the  spell ends. When the spell ends, your access to the Akashic Record ends, and all the information you downloaded returns to the Akashic Record.

Heightened (3rd) You  can  reference  your  comm  unit  three times before the spell ends.

## SPELL 8

SPELL 1

## SPELL 1

## Duration 1 day

You dispatch perfect documentation of the target's physical body to the Akashic Record, allowing it to later  recall  this record and reconstruct its body as it was when you cast this spell.  The  record  includes  the  target's  current  Hit  Points, augmentations,  attribute  modifiers,  and  any  afflictions  or conditions it had.

If  the  target  dies  of  anything  other  than  old  age,  it can  recall  its  recorded  body  from  the  Akashic  Record. This  process  takes  1  minute,  after  which  time  its  corpse disappears, and  the  target instantly reappears  in the recorded  body  in  the  corpse's  space  and  with  any  worn equipment. It re-forms standing and can choose to pick up any equipment it dropped in the space from when it died, assuming the equipment is still there. If it can't occupy that space, it appears as close to the space as possible, though it must still retrieve its equipment. It retains its mind as it was at the time of the body's death, so it regains no expended spells, Focus Points, or uses of special abilities. Any mental effects affecting the target at the time of its death persist in its new body.

Retrieving  the  body  from  the  Akashic  Record  or  having the duration expire removes the stored information from the Akashic Record, requiring you to cast this spell again.

Casting  the  spell  replaces  any  previous  record  you've stored with prior castings-you can store only one copy of any creature in the Akashic Record using this spell.

## ALARM

You ward an area to alert you when creatures enter without your permission. When you cast alarm ,  select  a  password. Whenever  a  Small  or  larger  corporeal  creature  enters  the spell's area without speaking the password, alarm sends your choice  of  a  mental  alert  (in  which  case  the  spell  gains  the mental trait) or an audible alarm with the sound and volume of a hand bell (in which case the spell gains the auditory trait). Either option automatically awakens you, and the bell allows each creature in the area to attempt a DC 15 Perception check to wake up. A creature aware of the alarm must succeed at a Stealth check against the spell's DC or trigger the spell when moving into the area.

Heightened (3rd) You can specify a trigger for which types of creatures sound the alarm spell, as described in Setting Triggers on page 301.

All targets in the area take 5d12 bludgeoning  damage  and  5d12  fire  damage,  and  they're exposed  to  extreme  radiation  ( GM Core 91)  that  uses  your spellcasting  DC  as  the  Fortitude  DC  for  radiation  sickness incurred  by  exposure  to  this  radiation.

## AUGURY

## CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE PREDICTION

Traditions divine, occult

Cast

10 minutes

You gain a vague glimpse of the future. During the casting of this spell, ask about the results of a particular course of action. The spell can predict results up to 30 minutes into the future and reveal the GM's best guess among the following outcomes: good, bad, mixed (the results will be a mix of good and bad),  and  nothing  (there  won't  be  particularly  good  or bad results).

The  GM rolls  a  secret  DC  6  flat  check.  On  a  failure,  the result  is  always  'nothing.'  This  makes  it  impossible  to  tell whether a 'nothing' result is accurate. If anyone asks about the  same  topic  as  the  first  casting  of augury during  an additional casting, the GM uses the secret roll result from the first casting. If circumstances change, though, it's possible to get a different result.

You  detect  illusion  magic  only  if  that  magic's  effect has  a  lower  rank  than  the  rank  of  your detect  magic spell. However, items that have an illusion aura but aren't deceptive  in  appearance  (such  as  an invisibility potion) typically are detected normally.

Heightened (3rd) You  learn  the  rank  or  level  of  the  most powerful magical effect the spell detects, as determined by the GM.

Heightened  (4th) As  3rd  rank,  but  you  also  pinpoint  the source of the highest-rank magic. Like for an imprecise sense, you don't learn the exact location, but can narrow down the source to within a 5-foot cube (or the nearest if larger than that).

## DETECT POISON [two-actions]

SPELL 1

## UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE DETECTION MANIPULATE

Traditions divine, primal

Range 30 feet; Targets 1 object or creature

You detect whether a creature is venomous or poisonous, or  if  an  object  is  poison  or  has  been  poisoned.  You  do not  ascertain  whether  the  target  is  poisonous  in  multiple ways, nor do you learn the type or types of poison. Certain substances, like lead and alcohol, are poisons and so mask other poisons.

Heightened (2nd) You learn the number and types of poison.

## DETECT SCRYING [two-actions]

CONCENTRATE

DETECTION

Traditions arcane, occult

SPELL 4

## CANTRIP 1

SPELL 8

MANIPULATE

Area

30-foot emanation

Duration 1 hour

By reading trace auras, you detect the presence of scrying effects  in  the  area.  If detect scrying is  higher  rank  than  a scrying effect, you gain a glimpse of the scrying creature and learn its approximate distance and direction.

Heightened  (6th) The  duration  is  until  your  next  daily preparations.

## DETECT THOUGHTS [two-actions]

## CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE MENTAL

Traditions

divine, occult

Area

30-foot emanation

Defense Will

You sense the presence of thinking creatures around you. You  detect  the  presence  or  absence  of  thoughts  from conscious creatures that have Intelligence modifiers of -3 or higher. You can choose to ignore the thoughts of creatures you're  familiar  with  so  they  don't  interfere  with  your detection of other thoughts. The spell can penetrate some barriers, but 3 feet of dirt or wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of metal, a thin sheet of lead, or any force barrier blocks it. Creatures who are immune to mental effects are immune to detection by this spell.

Heightened (4th) You detect the number of thinking minds and whether or not the creatures are telepathic. Creatures with telepathy have louder thoughts than creatures who don't  have  telepathy  and  might  be  able  to  sense  your intrusion, at the GM's discretion.

## DISAPPEARANCE [two-actions]

## ILLUSION MANIPULATE SUBTLE

Traditions arcane, occult

Range

touch; Targets 1 creature

Duration

10 minutes

You  shroud  a  creature  from  others'  senses.  The  target becomes  undetected,  not  just  to  sight  but  to  all  senses, allowing  the  target  to  count  as  invisible  no  matter  what precise and imprecise senses an observer might have. It's still  possible  for  a  creature  to  find  the  target  by  Seeking, looking  for  disturbed  dust,  hearing  gaps  in  the  sound spectrum,  or  finding  some  other  way  to  discover  the presence of an otherwise-undetectable creature.

<!-- image -->

## DISCHARGE [two-actions]

## CONCENTRATE ELECTRICITY MANIPULATE

Traditions arcane, primal

Range 30 feet; Targets 1  creature  or  object  with  the  tech trait

## Defense Will

You ignite a sudden spark of electricity that surges into a technological  creature  or  object.  You  de-energize  an  item with the tech trait or disrupt a creature with the tech trait, with effects based on the target being a creature or object.

- Creature If your target is a creature with the tech trait, it attempts a Will save. On a failure, the creature is glitching 1; on a critical failure, the creature is glitching 2.

SPELL 3

## SPELL 8

## SPELL 2

## PLA YER CORE

- Object If  you  target  an  attended  object,  the  creature with the object attempts a Will save. On a success, the object loses half of its maximum charges. On a failure, or if you target an unattended object, the object loses all its remaining charges.

## DISGUISE MAGIC

## CONCENTRATE ILLUSION MANIPULATE

Traditions arcane, occult

Cast 1 minute

Range 30 feet; Targets 1 item or spell effect

Duration until your next daily preparations

You alter how an item's or spell's magical aura appears to effects  like detect magic .  You  can  hide  the  auras  entirely, have an item register as a common item of lower level, or make  a  spell  register  as  a  common  spell  of  the  same  or lower rank. You can Dismiss the spell.

A caster using detect magic or read aura of a higher rank than disguise magic can  attempt  to  disbelieve  the  illusion using the skill matching the tradition of the spell (Arcana for arcane, Religion for divine, Occultism for occult, or Nature for  primal).  Further  attempts  by  the  same  caster  get  the same result as the initial check to disbelieve.

Heightened  (2nd) You  can  Cast  this  Spell  on  a  creature, disguising all items and spell effects on it.

## DISINTEGRATE [two-actions]

## ATTACK CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE

Traditions arcane

Range 120  feet; Targets 1  creature,  unattended  object,  or

force construct

Defense AC and basic Fortitude

A  black  tracer  bolt  flies  toward  your  target,  and  upon making  contact  intensifies  into  a  powerful  destructive beam.  Make  a  spell  attack  against  the  target.  If  you  hit an object or force construct (such as a wall of force ),  it's destroyed with no save unless it's an artifact or similarly powerful. A single casting can destroy no more than a 10foot cube of matter.

If you hit a creature, it takes 12d10 damage (no damage type) with a basic Fortitude save. If you critically hit, the target gets a result one degree of success worse than the outcome of its Fortitude save. A creature reduced to 0 HP is blasted to fine powder; its gear remains.

Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 2d10.

## DISPEL MAGIC [two-actions]

## CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE

Traditions arcane, divine, occult, primal

Range 120 feet; Targets 1 spell effect or unattended magic

item

You  unravel  the  magic  behind  a  spell  or  effect.  Attempt a  counteract  check  against  the  target  (page  301).  If  you successfully counteract a magic item, it becomes a mundane item  of  its  type  for  10  minutes.  This  doesn't  change  the item's non-magical properties. If the target is an artifact or similar item, you automatically fail.

## DISPELLING GLOBE [two-actions]

## SPELL 4

## UNCOMMON CONCENTRATE MANIPULATE

Traditions arcane, divine, occult

Area 10-foot burst centered on one corner of your space

Duration 10 minutes

You  create  an  immobile  globe  around  yourself.  It  attempts to  counteract  any  spell  from  outside  the  globe  whose  area or  targets  enter  into  it,  as  if  the  globe  were  a dispel magic spell 1 rank lower than its actual spell rank. If the counteract attempt  succeeds,  it  prevents  only  the  portion  of  the  spell that would have entered the globe (so if the spell also has targets outside the globe, or part of its area is beyond the globe, those targets or that area are affected normally). You must form the sphere in an unbroken open space, so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost (though creatures can enter the globe after the spell is cast).

If it sleeps the  full  8  hours  uninterrupted,  when  it  wakes,  it  counts as  having spent a day of downtime retraining, though it can't use dreaming potential for any retraining that would require  either  an  instructor  or  specialized  knowledge  it can't access within the dream.

- Shaking  Ground The  ground  is  difficult  terrain,  and creatures  on  it  take  a  -2  circumstance  penalty  to attack rolls, AC, and skill checks.
- Fissures Each creature on the ground must attempt a Reflex save at the start of its turn to keep its footing and avoid falling into 40-foot-deep fissures that open beneath it. The fissures are permanent, and their sides require successful DC 15 Athletics checks to Climb.
- Collapse Structures  and  ceilings  might  collapse.  The GM  rolls  a  flat  check  for  each  (DC  16  for  a  sturdy structure,  DC  14  for  an  average  structure  and  most natural  formations,  DC  9  for  a  shoddy  structure,  all adjusted higher or lower as the GM sees fit).
