These extra benefits are described at the end of the spell's stat block. Some heightened entries specify one or more ranks at which the spell must be prepared or cast to gain these extra advantages. Each of these heightened entries states specifically which aspects of the spell change at the given rank. Read the heightened entry only for the spell rank you're using or preparing; if its benefits are meant to include any of the effects of a lower-rank heightened entry, those benefits will be included in the entry.\n\nOther heightened entries give a number after a plus sign, indicating that heightening grants extra advantages over multiple ranks. The listed effect applies for every increment of ranks by which the spell is heightened above its lowest spell rank, and the benefit is cumulative. For example, slice reality says ' Heightened (+1) The damage increases by 1d8.' Because slice reality deals 7d8 void damage at 6th rank, a 7th-rank slice reality would deal 8d8 void damage, an 8thrank spell would deal 9d8 void damage, and so on.\n\nHeightened Spontaneous Spells\n\nIf you're a spontaneous spellcaster, you must know a spell at the specific rank that you want to cast it in order to heighten it. You can add a spell to your spell repertoire at more than a single rank so that you have more options when casting it. For example, if you added skyfire wings to your repertoire as a 3rd-rank spell and again as a 7th-rank spell, you could cast it as a 3rd-rank or a 7th-rank spell; however, you couldn't cast it as a 5th-rank spell.\n\nMany spontaneous spellcasting classes provide abilities like the signature spells class feature, which allows you to cast a limited number of spells as heightened versions even if you know the spell at only a single rank.\n\nAs a spontaneous caster, you can also choose to cast a lower-rank spell using a higher-rank spell slot without heightening it or knowing it at a higher rank. This casts the spell at the rank you know the spell, not the rank of the higher slot. The spell doesn't have any heightened effects, so it's usually not a very efficient use of your magic outside of highly specific circumstances. For instance, if your party was having trouble with an invisible enemy, and you had revealing light in your repertoire but had already spent all of your 2nd-rank spell slots, it might be worth it to use a 3rd-rank spell slot to cast the spell, even though it'd have no heightened benefit.",

      "text": "A spell with a touch range requires you to physically touch the target. You use your unarmed reach to determine whether you can touch the creature. You can usually touch them automatically, though the spell might specify that they can attempt a saving throw or that you must attempt a spell attack roll. If an ability increases the range of a touch spell, start at 0 feet and increase from there. AREAS Sometimes a spell has an area, which can be a burst, cone, emanation, or line (pages 420-421). If the spell originates from your position, the spell has only an area; if you can cause the spell's area to appear farther away from you, the spell has both a range and an area. TARGETS Some spells allow you to target a creature, an object, or something more specific. The target must be within the spell's range, and you must be able to see it (or otherwise perceive it with a precise sense) to target it. At the GM's discretion, you can attempt to target a creature you can't see, as described in Detecting Creatures on page 425.

If you notice a spell being cast, and you have that spell in your repertoire or prepared it that day (even if you already cast it), you automatically know what the spell is, including the rank to which it is heightened.\n\nIf you want to identify a spell but don't have it prepared or in your repertoire, you must spend an action on your turn attempting to identify it using Recall Knowledge. You typically notice a spell being cast due to its sensory spell manifestations (page 298). Identifying long-lasting spells that are already in place requires using Identify Magic instead of Recall Knowledge because you don't have the advantage of watching the spell being cast.\n\nCOUNTERACTING\n\nSome spells, such as dispel magic , can be used to eliminate the effects of other spells. At least one creature, object, or manifestation of the spell you are trying to counteract must be within range of the spell that you are using. You attempt a counteract check (page 423) using your Charisma (or other spellcasting attribute modifier) and your proficiency bonus for spell attack rolls.\n\nHOSTILE ACTIONS\n\nSometimes spells prevent a target from using hostile actions, or the spell ends if a creature uses any hostile actions. A hostile action is one that can harm or damage another creature, whether directly or indirectly, but not one that a creature is unaware could cause harm. For instance, casting sonic scream into a crowd would be a hostile action, but opening a door and accidentally freeing a horrible monster wouldn't be. The GM is the final arbitrator of what is a hostile action.",
