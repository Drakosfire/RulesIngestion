More importantly, Starfinder is a game where your character's choices determine how the story unfolds.\n\nStarfinder takes place following the Gap, an era of collective memory loss. Explore a galaxy full of magic and mystery, from the vibrant worlds and bustling satellites of the Pact Worlds to cosmic wonders and warring civilizations in Near Space or the distant regions of the perilous Vast. A Starfinder character's adventures might take them to sleepless megacities full of technological marvels, rugged alien planets prowled by dangerous monsters, or magical installations orbiting distant stars. Worlds of endless possibility await!\n\nWHAT IS A ROLEPLAYING GAME?\n\nA roleplaying game is an interactive story where one player, the Game Master (GM), sets the scene and presents challenges, while other players take the roles of player characters (PCs) and attempt to overcome those challenges. Danger comes in the form of monsters, hostile tech, and alien environments, but Starfinder conflicts also involve political schemes, puzzles, interpersonal drama, and more.\n\nThe game is typically played in a group of four to seven players, with one of those players serving as the group's GM. The GM prepares, presents, and presides over the game's setting and story, posing challenges and playing adversaries, allies, and bystanders alike. As each scene flows, every player contributes to the story, responding to situations according to the personality and abilities of their character. Combined with preassigned statistics, dice rolls add an element of chance to the game and determine whether characters succeed or fail at actions.\n\nTHE FLOW OF THE GAME\n\nStarfinder is played in sessions during which players gather in person or online for a few hours to play the game. A complete story can be as short as a single session, often referred to as a 'one-shot,' or it can stretch for multiple sessions, forming a campaign that might last for months or even years. If the GM enjoys telling the story and the players are entertained, the game can go on for as long as you like.\n\nA session can be mostly action, featuring battles with ferocious monsters, hacking computer terminals and magitech traps, and the completion of heroic missions. Alternatively,\n\nTHE FIRST RULE\n\nThe first rule of Starfinder is that this game is yours . Use it to tell the stories you want to tell, be the character you want to be, and share exciting adventures with friends. If any other rule gets in the way of your fun, you can alter or ignore it to fit your story as long as your group agrees. The true goal of Starfinder is for everyone to enjoy themselves.\n\nit could include unionizing miners on an asteroid teeming with megafauna, infiltrating a galactic empire's military, or bargaining with enigmatic spectras for a starship's speedy passage through the Drift. Ultimately, it's up to you and your group to determine what kind of game you're playing, from exploration of uncharted space to an intergalactic political drama, or anything in between.\n\nTHE PLAYERS\n\nEveryone involved in a Starfinder game is a player, including the Game Master, but for the sake of simplicity, 'player' usually refers to participants other than the GM. Before the game begins, players invent a history and personality for their characters, using the rules to determine their characters' statistics, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. The GM might limit the options available to the players during character creation, but these restrictions should be discussed ahead of time so everyone can create interesting heroes. In general, the only limits to character concepts are the players' imaginations and the GM's guidelines.\n\nDuring the game, players describe the actions their characters take and roll dice, using their characters' abilities. The GM resolves the outcome of these actions. Some players enjoy acting out (or roleplaying) what they do as if they were their characters, while others describe their characters' actions as if they were telling a story. Do whatever feels best!\n\nIf this is your first experience with a roleplaying game, it's recommended that you take on the role of a player to familiarize yourself with the rules and the galaxy.",

When these dice are mentioned in the text, they're indicated by a 'd' followed by the number of sides on the die. Starfinder uses 4-sided dice (or d4), 6-sided dice (d6), 8-sided dice (d8), 10-sided dice (d10), 12-sided dice (d12), and 20-sided dice (d20). If you need to roll multiple dice, a number before the 'd' tells you how many. For example, '4d6' means you should roll four dice, all 6-sided. If a rule asks for d%, you generate a number from 1 to 100 by rolling two 10-sided dice, treating one as the tens place and the other as the ones place.\n\nTHE GAME MASTER\n\nWhile the other players create and control their characters, the Game Master (or GM) is in charge of the story and setting. The GM describes all the situations the player characters experience in an adventure, considers how the actions of player characters affect the story, and interprets the rules along the way. The Game Master uses the rules and advice found in Starfinder GM Core .\n\nThe GM can create a new adventure-crafting a narrative, selecting monsters, and assigning rewards on their ownor they can instead rely on a published adventure, using it as a basis for the session and modifying it as needed to accommodate their individual players and the group's style of play. Some GMs run games that combine original and published content, mixing both together to form a new story.\n\nBeing the GM is a challenge, requiring you to adjudicate the rules, narrate the story, and juggle other responsibilities. But it can also be very rewarding and worth all the work required to run a good game. If it's your first time running a game, remember that the only thing that matters is that everyone, including you, has a fun time. Everything else will come naturally with practice and patience.\n\nGAMING IS FOR ALL\n\nWhether you're the GM or a player, participating in a tabletop roleplaying game includes a social contract: everyone's gathered together to have fun. For many, roleplaying is a way to escape the troubles of everyday life. Be mindful of everyone at the table and what they want out of the game; when a group gathers for the first time, they should talk about what they hope to experience at the table, as well as any topics they'd like to avoid. Everyone should understand that elements might come up that make some players feel uncomfortable or even unwelcome, and everyone should agree to respect those boundaries during play. That way, everyone can enjoy the game together.\n\nStarfinder is a game for everyone, regardless of their age, gender, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or any other identities and life experiences. It's the responsibility of all of the players, not just the GM, to make sure the game is fun and welcoming for everyone.\n\nTOOLS OF PLAY\n\nIn addition to this book, there are a few things you will need to play Starfinder. These supplies can be found at your local hobby shop or online at paizo.com .\n\nCharacter Sheet: Each player needs a character sheet to create their character and to record what happens to them during play. You can find a character sheet in the back of this book and online as a free PDF.\n\nDice: The players and GM need at least one set of polyhedral dice, although most participants bring their own. Six-sided dice are quite common, but all the dice in the set can be found at hobby game stores or online. See the Dice sidebar for an overview of the different kinds of dice and how they are discussed in the text.\n\nAdventure: Every group needs an adventure to play, whether it's designed by the GM or found in a published resource. You can find a variety of exciting adventures and even entire Adventure Path campaigns at paizo.com .\n\nStarfinder Alien Core: From the vanguard components of the Swarm to immensely powerful starmetal dragons, monsters are a common threat that the PCs might face, and each type has its own statistics and abilities. These can be found in Starfinder Alien Core , an invaluable book for GMs. Monster statistics can also be found online for free at paizo. com/prd .\n\nMaps and Miniatures: The chaos of combat can be difficult to imagine, so many groups use maps to represent the battlefield. These maps are marked with a 1-inch grid, and each square usually represents 5 feet in the game. Miniatures and illustrated tokens called pawns are used to represent the characters and the adversaries they face.\n\nBASICS OF PLAY\n\nDEFINING CHARACTERS\n\nIn Starfinder, the players take on the role of player characters (PCs) , while the Game Master portrays nonplayer characters (NPCs) and monsters . While PCs and NPCs are both important to the story, they serve very different purposes in the game. PCs are the protagonists-the narrative is about them-while NPCs are allies, contacts, adversaries, and villains. That said, PCs, NPCs, and monsters share several characteristics.\n\nLevel is one of the most important statistics of the game, as it conveys the approximate power and capabilities of every individual creature.

As the characters overcome challenges, defeat foes, and complete adventures, they accumulate Experience Points (XP) . Every time a character amasses 1,000 XP, they go up a level, gaining new abilities so they can take on even greater challenges. A 1st-level PC might face off against a rampant assembly ooze or a hardlight scamp, but at 20th level, that same character might be able to decimate an army with a supermassive black hole or trade blows with a god.\n\nIn addition to level, characters are defined by attributes , which measure raw potential and are used to calculate most of their other statistics. There are six attributes in the game. Strength represents a character's physical might, while Dexterity represents agility and their ability to avoid danger. Constitution indicates a character's overall health and well-being. Intelligence represents raw knowledge and problem-solving ability, while Wisdom measures a character's insight and their ability to evaluate a situation. Finally, Charisma indicates charm, persuasiveness, and force of personality. Attribute modifiers for ordinary creatures range from as low as -5 to as high as +5, with +0 representing average human capabilities. High-level characters can have attribute modifiers that range much higher than +5. An attribute modifier above the average increases your chance of success at related tasks, while those below the average decrease your chance.\n\nYour player character is also defined by some key choices you make. The first choice is a PC's ancestry , representing the character's parents and heritage, such as barathu, human, or vesk. Next up is the PC's background , which describes their upbringing, from sly smuggler to famous icon. Finally, and most importantly, a PC's class defines the majority of their aptitudes and abilities, like a soldier's training to put down heavy fire or a witchwarper's knack for altering reality.\n\nTHE GALAXY AS A PARTICIPANT\n\nAside from characters and monsters, the galaxy of Starfinder itself can be a force at the table and in the narrative. While the presence of the larger setting can sometimes be an obvious hazard, such as when a firestorm rages through an alien jungle, the setting can also act in subtler, smaller ways. Traps and treasures are just as important in many tales as monstrous foes. To help you understand these game elements, many of them use the same characteristics as characters and monsters. For example, most environmental hazards have a level that indicates how dangerous they are, and the level of a magic item gives you a sense of its overall power and impact on a story.\n\ntake turns describing what their characters attempt to do, while the GM determines the outcome, with everyone working together to create the story. The GM also describes the environment, other characters' actions, and events. For example, the GM might announce that the PCs' home world is under attack by the Swarm. The characters might fight off the first strike, then track the invaders back to a planetoid in the Vast-just as a jinsul raiding party arrives! The PCs have the choice of battling Swarm emganats, fending off jinsul invaders, or both. Whatever they decide, their success depends on their choices and their die rolls.\n\nA single narrative-including the setup, plot, and conclusion-is called an adventure . A series of adventures creates an even larger narrative called a campaign . An adventure might take several sessions to complete, whereas a campaign might take months or even years!\n\nCREATING A NARRATIVE\n\nCharacters and their choices create the story of Starfinder, but how they interact with each other and the galaxy around them is governed by rules. So, while you might decide that your character steals a starship and takes off on a perilous interstellar journey, your character's chance of success is determined by their abilities, the choices you make, and the roll of the dice.\n\nThe GM determines the premise and background of most adventures, although character histories and personalities should also play a part.

THE GALAXY AS A PARTICIPANT Aside from characters and monsters, the galaxy of Starfinder itself can be a force at the table and in the narrative. While the presence of the larger setting can sometimes be an obvious hazard, such as when a firestorm rages through an alien jungle, the setting can also act in subtler, smaller ways. Traps and treasures are just as important in many tales as monstrous foes. To help you understand these game elements, many of them use the same characteristics as characters and monsters. For example, most environmental hazards have a level that indicates how dangerous they are, and the level of a magic item gives you a sense of its overall power and impact on a story. take turns describing what their characters attempt to do, while the GM determines the outcome, with everyone working together to create the story. The GM also describes the environment, other characters' actions, and events. For example, the GM might announce that the PCs' home world is under attack by the Swarm. The characters might fight off the first strike, then track the invaders back to a planetoid in the Vast-just as a jinsul raiding party arrives! The PCs have the choice of battling Swarm emganats, fending off jinsul invaders, or both. Whatever they decide, their success depends on their choices and their die rolls. A single narrative-including the setup, plot, and conclusion-is called an adventure . A series of adventures creates an even larger narrative called a campaign . An adventure might take several sessions to complete, whereas a campaign might take months or even years! CREATING A NARRATIVE Characters and their choices create the story of Starfinder, but how they interact with each other and the galaxy around them is governed by rules. So, while you might decide that your character steals a starship and takes off on a perilous interstellar journey, your character's chance of success is determined by their abilities, the choices you make, and the roll of the dice. The GM determines the premise and background of most adventures, although character histories and personalities should also play a part. Once a game session begins, the players",

      "content": "Section: STARFINDER | Page: 8\n\nPLAYING THE GAME\n\nIn a Starfinder game, three modes of play determine the pacing of each scene in the story. Most of your character's time is spent in exploration , uncovering mysteries, solving problems, and interacting with other characters. The galaxy is filled with danger, however, and characters often find themselves in an encounter , fighting hostile parties when negotiations go south and battling fearsome alien monsters. Finally, time moves quickly when the characters enjoy downtime , a respite from the galaxy's troubles and a chance to rest and train for future activities. Throughout an adventure, gameplay moves between these three modes many times, as needed for the story. The more you play the game, the more you'll see that each mode has its own play style, but moving from mode to mode has a few hard boundaries.\n\nDuring the game, your character will face situations where the outcome is uncertain. A character might need to navigate while inside the Drift, survive in an alien desert, or sneak past a corporate security robot, all of which are dangerous tasks with a price for failure. In such cases, the acting character (or characters) is asked to attempt a check to determine whether or not they succeed. A check is usually made by rolling a single 20-sided die (a d20) and adding a number based on the relevant attribute. In such cases, rolling high is always good.\n\nOnce a check is rolled, the GM compares the result to a target number called the difficulty class (DC) to determine the outcome. If the result of the check is equal to or greater than the DC, the check is successful. If it's lower, the check is a failure. Beating the DC by 10 or more is referred to as a critical success , which usually grants an especially positive outcome. Similarly, failing the check by 10 or more is a critical failure (sometimes called a fumble). This sometimes results in additional negative effects. You also often score a critical success by rolling a 20 on the die when attempting a check (before adding anything). Likewise, rolling a 1 on the die when attempting a check often results in a critical failure. Note that not all checks have a special effect on a critical success or critical failure, and such results should be treated just like an ordinary success or failure instead.\n\nFor example, while aboard a starship traveling to a faraway world, your character might find a faster route through an uncharted asteroid field. You decide to go for it, but the GM declares this a dangerous task and asks you to roll a Piloting skill check (since navigation is covered by the Piloting skill). On your character sheet, you see that your character has a +8 modifier for such checks. Rolling the d20, you get an 18, for a total of 26. The GM compares this to the DC (which was 16) and finds that you got a critical success (since the result exceeded the DC by 10). Your character charts a safe path around every asteroid without scratching the hull. Had you gotten a result less than 26 but equal to or greater than 16, your character's route would've taken your ship halfway through the debris field. Had your result been less than 16, your character might have gotten lost among the spinning chunks of rock and ice or, on a critical failure (6 or less), crashed the ship into one of them!\n\nProficiency is a simple way of assessing your character's general level of training and aptitude for a given task. It's broken into five different ranks: untrained , trained , expert , master , and legendary . Each rank grants a different proficiency bonus. If you're untrained at a statistic, your proficiency bonus is +0; you must rely solely on the raw potential represented by your attribute modifier. If your proficiency rank for a statistic is trained, expert, master, and legendary, your bonus equals your character's level plus another number based on the rank (2, 4, 6, and 8, respectively). Proficiency ranks are part of almost every statistic in the game.\n\nEXPLORATION\n\nMost of the time, your character will explore an environment, interact with other characters, travel from place to place, and overcome challenges. This is called exploration. Gameplay is relatively free-form during exploration, with players responding to the narrative whenever they have an idea of what to do next. Ransacking an abandoned warehouse and riding a crowded gravtrain are both examples of exploration.",

Some of the most important terms mentioned on previous pages are also included here for reference.\n\nAction\n\nDuring encounters, each creature gets three actions during their turn. These actions are spent to attack, interact with objects, move, and use special abilities. Actions available to all characters can be found in Chapter 8.\n\nAncestry\n\nArmor Class (AC)\n\nAll creatures in the game have an Armor Class. This score represents how hard it is to hit and damage a creature. It serves as the Difficulty Class for hitting a creature with an attack.\n\nAttack\n\nWhen a creature tries to harm another creature, it makes a Strike or uses some other attack action. Most attacks are Strikes made with a weapon, but a character might Strike with their fist, grapple or shove with their appendages, or attack with a spell.\n\nAttribute Modifier\n\nEach creature has six attribute modifiers: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each of these numbers represents a creature's raw potential and general training. Attributes are described in full later in this chapter.\n\nBackground\n\nA background represents what a character experienced before they became an adventurer. Each background grants a feat and training in one or more skills. You can read more about backgrounds in Chapter 2.\n\nBonuses and Penalties\n\nBonuses and penalties apply to checks and certain statistics. There are several types of bonuses and penalties. If you have more than one bonus of the same type, you use only the highest bonus. Likewise, you use only the worst penalty of each type.\n\nCheck\n\nWhen a character attempts an action where success is uncertain, they may roll a check. This is a roll of one 20-sided die plus the named proficiency bonus. For example, a Perception check would add your Perception proficiency.\n\nClass\n\nCondition\n\nAn ongoing effect that changes how a character can act, or that alters some of their statistics, is called a condition. The rules for the basic conditions used in the game can be found in the Conditions Appendix at the back of this book.\n\nCurrency\n\nThe most common currency in the game is credits. Characters begin play with 150 credits to spend on equipment.\n\nFeat\n\nA feat is an ability you can select for your character due to their ancestry, background, class, general training, or skill training. Some feats grant the ability to use special actions, while others make your existing actions more effective.\n\nGame Master (GM)\n\nThe Game Master is the player who adjudicates the rules and narrates the various elements of the Starfinder story and world that the other players explore.

In this adventure, Thurston is the GM. Jenny is playing Obozaya, an aggressive vesk soldier; Jessica is playing Dae, a flashy pahtra solarian; Mike is taking on the role of Zemir, a human witchwarper who's seen it all in every reality; and Dustin is playing Chk Chk, a moody shirren mystic who worships Zon-Shelyn. The party has chosen to fly their starship to investigate a disturbance near a Drift navigation beacon.\n\nGroup Chat is a mystic ability that lets Chk Chk and anyone in his bond communicate telepathically with each other. Most party banter happens in Group Chat.\n\nZemir (Mike):\n\nThurston:\n\nZemir (Mike):\n\nThurston:\n\nChk Chk (Dustin):\n\nThurston:\n\nDae (Jessica):\n\nObozaya (Jenny):\n\nThurston:\n\nObozaya (Jenny):\n\n'Thanks, Chk Chk.' I chug some coffee and try again. 13! I've got a +7 to Piloting so\n\nthat's a 20!\n\nThe ship\n\nzooms safely\n\nthrough the\n\ndebris until the beacon you were sent to investigate looms in the viewport. It's a\n\ncylindrical silver satellite twice the size of your ship lit by blinking red lights, anchored\n\nin the churn of hyperspace by the prayers of Triune's tech priests.\n\nI fly the ship closer so we can investigate.\n\nUp close, you notice an armored ysoki clinging to the side of the satellite.\n\n'Zemir, can you get us closer?' I'm going to send the ysoki a telepathic message to calm\n\nthem down while we figure out a way to help. 'Don't let fear erase you; let the void\n\nembrace you.' Is there any response?\n\nNone.

      "text": "Section: INTRODUCTION | Page: 12 EXAMPLE OF PLAY The following example is presented to give you a better idea of how Starfinder is played. In this adventure, Thurston is the GM. Jenny is playing Obozaya, an aggressive vesk soldier; Jessica is playing Dae, a flashy pahtra solarian; Mike is taking on the role of Zemir, a human witchwarper who's seen it all in every reality; and Dustin is playing Chk Chk, a moody shirren mystic who worships Zon-Shelyn. The party has chosen to fly their starship to investigate a disturbance near a Drift navigation beacon. Group Chat is a mystic ability that lets Chk Chk and anyone in his bond communicate telepathically with each other. Most party banter happens in Group Chat. Zemir (Mike): Thurston: Zemir (Mike): Thurston: Chk Chk (Dustin): Thurston: Dae (Jessica): Obozaya (Jenny): Thurston: Obozaya (Jenny): 'Thanks, Chk Chk.' I chug some coffee and try again. 13! I've got a +7 to Piloting so that's a 20! The ship zooms safely through the debris until the beacon you were sent to investigate looms in the viewport. It's a cylindrical silver satellite twice the size of your ship lit by blinking red lights, anchored in the churn of hyperspace by the prayers of Triune's tech priests. I fly the ship closer so we can investigate. Up close, you notice an armored ysoki clinging to the side of the satellite. 'Zemir, can you get us closer?' I'm going to send the ysoki a telepathic message to calm them down while we figure out a way to help. 'Don't let fear erase you; let the void embrace you.' Is there any response? None. Only silence. I don't like that. 'Hey Obo, can I borrow your jetpack?' 'Only if you don't break it.' Dae, are you installing Obozaya's jetpack into your armor? Paws off! I'll do it with Quick Install. Quick Install is a skill feat that lets Obozaya Install an Upgrade in 1 minute, instead of the 10 minutes this activity would normally take. Dae is part of Chk Chk's mystic bond, so he knows Dae is alive and not far away. Everyone rolls Perception for their initiative. Mike gets a total of 20. Jessica rolls 12, Dustin rolls 16, and Jenny rolls 10. Thurston rolls for the driftdead, getting a 19 and 14. He secretly rolls for the ysoki in the airlock and gets a 13.
